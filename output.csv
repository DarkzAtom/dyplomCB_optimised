2025-05-20 02:13:48,"May 19, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/rvtools-official-site-hacked-to-deliver.html,RVTools Official Site Hacked to Deliver Bumblebee Malware via Trojanized Installer,"The official site for RVTools has been hacked to serve a compromised installer for the popular VMware environment reporting utility.
""Robware.net and RVTools.com are currently offline. We are working expeditiously to restore service and appreciate your patience,"" the company said in a statement posted on its website.
""Robware.net and RVTools.com are the only authorized and supported websites for RVTools software. Do not search for or download purported RVTools software from any other websites or sources.""

The development comes after security researcher Aidan Leon revealed that an infected version of the installer downloaded from the website was being used to sideload a malicious DLL that turned out to be a known malware loader called Bumblebee.
It's currently not known how long the trojanized version of RVTools had been available for download and how many had installed it before the site was taken offline.
In the interim, users are recommended to verify the installer's hash and review any execution of version.dll from user directories.
The disclosure comes as it has come to light that the official software supplied with Procolored printers included a Delphi-based backdoor called XRed and a clipper malware dubbed SnipVex that's capable of substituting wallet addresses in the clipboard with that of a hard-coded address.
Details of the malicious activity were first discovered by Cameron Coward, who is behind the YouTube channel Serial Hobbyism.
XRed, believed to be active since at least 2019, comes with features to collect system information, log keystrokes, propagate via connected USB drives, and execute commands sent from an attacker-controlled server to capture screenshots, enumerate file systems and directories, download files, and delete files from the system.
""[SnipVex] searches the clipboard for content that resembles a BTC address and replaces it with the attacker's address, such that cryptocurrency transactions will be diverted to the attacker,"" G DATA researcher Karsten Hahn, who further investigated the incident, said.

But in an interesting twist, the malware infects .EXE files with the clipper functionality and makes use of an infection marker sequence – 0x0A 0x0B 0x0C – at the end to avoid re-infecting the files a second time. The wallet address in question has received 9.30857859 BTC (about $974,000) to date.
Procolored has since acknowledged that the software packages were uploaded to the Mega file hosting service in October 2024 via USB drives and that the malware may have been introduced during this process. Software downloads are currently only available for F13 Pro, VF13 Pro, and V11 Pro products.
""The malware's command-and-control server has been offline since February 2024,"" Hahn noted. ""So it is not possible that XRed established a successful remote connection after that date. The accompanying clipbanker virus SnipVex is still a serious threat. Although transactions to the BTC address stopped on March 3, 2024, the file infection itself damages systems."""
2025-05-20 02:13:48,"May 19, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/ransomware-gangs-use-skitnet-malware.html,Ransomware Gangs Use Skitnet Malware for Stealthy Data Theft and Remote Access,"Several ransomware actors are using a malware called Skitnet as part of their post-exploitation efforts to steal sensitive data and establish remote control over compromised hosts.
""Skitnet has been sold on underground forums like RAMP since April 2024,"" Swiss cybersecurity company PRODAFT told The Hacker News. ""However, since early 2025, we have observed multiple ransomware operators using it in real-world attacks."" 
""For example, in April 2025, Black Basta leveraged Skitnet in Teams-themed phishing campaigns targeting enterprise environments. With its stealth features and flexible architecture, Skitnet appears to be gaining traction rapidly within the ransomware ecosystem.""
Skitnet, also called Bossnet, is a multi-stage malware developed by a threat actor tracked by the company under the name LARVA-306. A notable aspect of the malicious tool is that it uses programming languages like Rust and Nim to launch a reverse shell over DNS and evade detection.
It also incorporates persistence mechanisms, remote access tools, commands for data exfiltration, and even download a .NET loader binary that can be used to serve additional payloads, making it a versatile threat.

First advertised on April 19, 2024, Skitnet is offered to potential customers as a ""compact package"" comprising a server component and malware. The initial executable is a Rust binary that decrypts and runs an embedded payload that's compiled in Nim.
""The primary function of this Nim binary is to establish a reverse shell connection with the C2 [command-and-control] server via DNS resolution,"" PRODAFT said. ""To evade detection, it employs the GetProcAddress function to dynamically resolve API function addresses rather than using traditional import tables.""
The Nim-based binary further starts multiple threads to send DNS requests every 10 seconds, read DNS responses and extract commands to be executed on the host, and transmit the results of the execution of the command back to the server. The commands are issued via a C2 panel that's used to manage the infected hosts.
Some of the supported PowerShell commands are listed below -

Startup, which ensures persistence by creating shortcuts in the Startup directory of the victim's device
Screen, which captures a screenshot of the victim's desktop
Anydesk/Rutserv, which deploys a legitimate remote desktop software like AnyDesk or Remote Utilities (""rutserv.exe"")
Shell, to run PowerShell scripts hosted on a remote server and send the results back to the C2 server
AV, which gathers a list of installed security products

""Skitnet is a multi-stage malware that leverages multiple programming languages, and encryption techniques,"" PRODAFT said. ""By using Rust for payload decryption and manual mapping, followed by a Nim-based reverse shell communicating over DNS, the malware tries to evade traditional security measures.""

The disclosure comes as Zscaler ThreatLabz detailed another malware loader dubbed TransferLoader that's being used to deliver a ransomware strain called Morpheus targeting an American law firm.
Active since at least February 2025, TransferLoader incorporates three components, a downloader, a backdoor, and a specialized loader for the backdoor, enabling the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.
While the downloader is designed to fetch and execute a payload from a C2 server and simultaneously run a PDF decoy file, the backdoor is responsible for running commands issued by the server, as well as updating its own configuration.
""The backdoor utilizes the decentralized InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) peer-to-peer platform as a fallback channel for updating the command-and-control (C2) server,"" the cybersecurity company said. ""The developers of TransferLoader use obfuscation methods to make the reverse engineering process more tedious."""
2025-05-20 02:13:52,"May 19, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/why-ctem-is-winning-bet-for-cisos-in.html,Why CTEM is the Winning Bet for CISOs in 2025,"Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) has moved from concept to cornerstone, solidifying its role as a strategic enabler for CISOs. No longer a theoretical framework, CTEM now anchors today's cybersecurity programs by continuously aligning security efforts with real-world risk.
At the heart of CTEM is the integration of Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV), an advanced, offensive methodology powered by proactive security tools including External Attack Surface Management (ASM), autonomous penetration testing and red teaming, and Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS). Together, these AEV tools transform how enterprises proactively identify, validate, and reduce risks, turning threat exposure into a manageable business metric.
CTEM reflects a broader evolution in how security leaders measure effectiveness and allocate resources. As board expectations grow and cyber risk becomes inseparable from business risk, CISOs are leveraging CTEM to drive measurable, outcome-based security initiatives. Early adopters report improved risk visibility, faster validation and remediation cycles, and tighter alignment between security investments and business priorities.1 With tools like ASM and autonomous pentesting delivering real-time insights into exposure, CTEM empowers CISOs to adopt a continuous, adaptive model that keeps pace with attacker techniques and the evolving threat landscape.
CTEM's Moment Has Arrived#
CTEM introduces a continuous, iterative process encompassing three pillars: Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV), Exposure Assessment Platforms (EAP), and Exposure Management (EM). These methodologies ensure enterprises can dynamically assess and respond to threats, aligning security efforts with business objectives.1 Gartner underscores the significance of CTEM, predicting that by 2026, organizations prioritizing security investments based on a CTEM program will be three times less likely to suffer a breach.2
Adversarial Exposure Validation (AEV): Simulating Real-World Threats#
AEV strengthens CTEM by continuously validating the effectiveness of security controls through the simulated exploitation of assets using real-world attacker behaviors. This often involves the use of automation, AI, and machine learning to replicate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, helping enterprises to proactively identify exploitable exposures before they can be leveraged in an actual attack. This proactive approach is crucial in understanding weaknesses and refining defenses more effectively.
Attack Surface Management (ASM): Expanding Visibility#
ASM complements CTEM by providing comprehensive visibility into an enterprise's digital footprint. By continuously discovering, prioritizing, and monitoring assets, ASM enables security teams to identify potential vulnerabilities and exposures promptly. This expanded visibility is essential for effective threat exposure management, ensuring that no asset remains unmonitored. AEV transforms ASM from a map into a mission plan, and enterprises need it urgently.
Autonomous Penetration Testing and Red Teaming: Improving Scalability#
The integration of autonomous penetrating testing and red teaming into CTEM frameworks marks a significant advancement in cybersecurity practices. Autonomous pentesting, for example, delivers real-time, scalable, and actionable insights unlike periodic assessments. This shift enhances operational efficiency while proactively identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in real-time. While regulatory compliance remains important, it is no longer the sole driver – modern mandates increasingly emphasize continuous, proactive security testing.
Breach and Attack Simulation (BAS): Continuous Security Validation#
BAS tools also play a role in CTEM by automating the simulation of known attack techniques across the kill chain – ranging from phishing and lateral movement to data exfiltration. Unlike autonomous pentesting, which actively exploits vulnerabilities, BAS focuses on continuously validating the effectiveness of security controls without causing disruption. These simulated attacks help uncover blind spots, misconfigurations, and detection and response gaps across endpoints, networks, and cloud environments. By aligning results with threat intelligence and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, BAS enables security teams to prioritize remediation based on real exposure and risk, helping CISOs ensure their defenses are not only in place, but operationally effective.
The Impetus Behind CTEM's Rise#
The rapid adoption of CTEM in 2025 is no coincidence. As cyber risks grow more complex and dynamic, enterprises are embracing CTEM not just as a framework, but as an effective cyber strategy that yields measurable results. Several converging trends, ranging from evolving threat tactics to regulatory pressure and expanding digital footprints, are driving security leaders to prioritize continuous validation, real-time visibility, and operational efficiency across the attack surface. Several factors contribute to the widespread adoption of CTEM:

Scalability: The rapid shift to cloud-native architectures, growing supply chain, and interconnected systems has expanded the attack surface. CTEM delivers the visibility and control needed to manage this complexity at scale.
Operational Efficiency: By integrating tools and automating threat validation, CTEM reduces redundancy, streamlines workflows, and accelerates response times.
Measurable Outcomes: CTEM enables CISOs to shift from abstract risk discussions to data-driven decisions by providing clear metrics on exposure, control effectiveness, and remediation progress, supporting better alignment with business objectives and board-level reporting.
Regulatory Compliance: With rising enforcement of cybersecurity regulations like NIS2, DORA, and SEC reporting mandates, CTEM's continuous validation and visibility help enterprises stay compliant and audit ready.

Conclusion#
Cybersecurity cannot evolve by standing still, and neither can security leaders and their organizations. The shift toward a proactive, measurable, and continuous approach to threat exposure is not only necessary but achievable. In fact, it's the only viable path forward. CTEM isn't just another framework, it's a blueprint for transforming security into a business-aligned, data-driven discipline. By embracing real-time validation, prioritizing exposures that matter, and proving effectiveness with metrics that resonate beyond the SOC, CISOs are moving the industry beyond checkboxes toward true resilience. Today, the enterprises that lead in cybersecurity will be the ones that measure it and manage it, continuously.

The vulnerabilities, both of which were exploited as a zero-day at Pwn2Own Berlin, are listed below -

CVE-2025-4918 - An out-of-bounds access vulnerability when resolving Promise objects that could allow an attacker to perform read or write on a JavaScript Promise object
CVE-2025-4919 - An out-of-bounds access vulnerability when optimizing linear sums that could allow an attacker to perform read or write on a JavaScript object by confusing array index sizes

In other words, successful exploitation of either of the flaws could permit an adversary to achieve out-of-bounds read or write, which could then be abused to access otherwise sensitive information or result in memory corruption that could pave the way for code execution.

The vulnerabilities affect the following versions of the Firefox browser -

All versions of Firefox before 138.0.4 (including Firefox for Android)
All versions of Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) before 128.10.1
All versions of Firefox ESR before 115.23.1

Edouard Bochin and Tao Yan from Palo Alto Networks have been credited with finding and reporting CVE-2025-4918. The discovery of CVE-2025-4919 has been credited to Manfred Paul.
It's worth noting that both shortcomings were demonstrated at the Pwn2Own Berlin hacking contest last week for which they were awarded $50,000 each.
With web browsers continuing to be an attractive vector for malware delivery, users are advised to update their instances to the latest version to safeguard against potential threats.
""Neither of the attacks managed to break out of our sandbox, which is required to gain control over the user's system,"" Mozilla said in a statement. ""Despite the limited impact of these attacks, all users and administrators are advised to update Firefox as soon as possible."""

Marbled Dust Exploits Output Messenger 0-Day — Microsoft revealed that a Türkiye-affiliated threat actor codenamed Marbled Dust exploited as zero-day a security flaw in an Indian enterprise communication platform called Output Messenger as part of a cyber espionage attack campaign since April 2024. The attacks, the company said, are associated with the Kurdish military operating in Iraq. The attacks exploited CVE-2025-27920, a directory traversal vulnerability affecting version 2.0.62 that allows remote attackers to access or execute arbitrary files. It was addressed in December 2024.
Konni APT Focuses on Ukraine in New Phishing Campaign — The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Konni APT has been attributed to a phishing campaign targeting government entities in Ukraine, indicating the threat actor's targeting beyond Russia amidst the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war. Proofpoint, which disclosed details of the activity, said the objective of the attacks is to collect intelligence on the ""trajectory of the Russian invasion."" The attack chains entail the use of phishing emails that impersonate a fictitious senior fellow at a non-existent think tank, tricking recipients into visiting credential harvesting pages or downloading malware that can conduct extensive reconnaissance of the compromised machines.
Coinbase Discloses Data Breach — Cryptocurrency giant Coinbase disclosed that unknown cyber actors broke into its systems and stole account data for a small subset of its customers. The activity bribed its customer support agents based in India to obtain a list of customers, who were then approached as part of a social engineering attack to transfer their digital assets to a wallet under the threat actor's control. The attackers also unsuccessfully attempted to extort the company for $20 million on May 11, 2025, by claiming to have information about certain customer accounts as well as internal documents. The compromised agents have since been terminated. While no passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed, the attackers made away with some amount of personal information, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, government ID images, and account balances. Coinbase did not disclose how many of its customers fell for the scam. Besides voluntarily reimbursing retail customers who were duped into sending cryptocurrency to scammers, Coinbase is offering a $20 million reward to anyone who can help identify and bring down the perpetrators of the cyber attack.
APT28 Behind Attacks Targeting Webmail Services — APT28, a hacking group linked to Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU), has been targeting webmail servers such as Roundcube, Horde, MDaemon, and Zimbra via cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The attacks, ongoing since at least 2023, targeted governmental entities and defense companies in Eastern Europe, although governments in Africa, Europe, and South America were also singled out. The victims in 2024 alone included officials from regional national governments in Ukraine, Greece, Cameroon and Serbia, military officials in Ukraine and Ecuador, and employees of defense contracting firms in Ukraine, Romania and Bulgaria. The group's spear-phishing campaign used fake headlines mimicking prominent Ukrainian news outlets like the Kyiv Post about the Russia-Ukraine war, seemingly in an attempt to entice targets into opening the messages using the affected webmail clients. Those who opened the email messages using the affected webmail clients were served, via the XSS flaws, a custom JavaScript payload capable of exfiltrating contacts and email data from their mailboxes. One of the payloads could steal passwords and two-factor authentication codes, allowing the attackers to bypass account protections. The malware is also designed to harvest the email credentials, either by tricking the browser or password manager into pasting those credentials into a hidden form or getting the user to log out, whereupon they were served a bogus login page.
Earth Ammit Breaches Drone Supply Chains to Target Taiwan and South Korea — The threat actor known as Earth Ammit targeted a broader range of organizations than just Taiwanese drone manufacturers, as initially supposed. While the set of attacks was believed to be confined to drone manufacturers in Taiwan, a subsequent analysis has uncovered that the campaign is more broader and sustained in scope than previously thought, hitting the heavy industry, media, technology, software services, healthcare, satellite, and military-adjacent supply chains, and payment service providers in both South Korea and Taiwan. The attacks targeted software vendors and service providers as a way to reach their desired victims, who were the vendors' downstream customers. ""Earth Ammit's strategy centered around infiltrating the upstream segment of the drone supply chain. By compromising trusted vendors, the group positioned itself to target downstream customers – demonstrating how supply chain attacks can ripple out and cause broad, global consequences,"" Trend Micro noted. ""Earth Ammit's long-term goal is to compromise trusted networks via supply chain attacks, allowing them to target high-value entities downstream and amplify their reach.""

Attackers Leverage PyInstaller to Drop Infostealers on Macs — Attackers are using PyInstaller to deploy information stealers on macOS systems. These ad-hoc signed samples bundle Python code into Mach-O executables using PyInstaller, allowing them to be run without requiring Python to be installed or meet version compatibility requirements. ""As infostealers continue to become more prevalent in the macOS threat landscape, threat actors will continue the search for new ways to distribute them,"" Jamf said. ""While the use of PyInstaller to package malware is not uncommon, this marks the first time we've observed it being used to deploy an infostealer on macOS.""
Kosovo National Extradited to the U.S. for Running BlackDB.cc — A 33-year-old Kosovo national named Liridon Masurica has been extradited to the United States to face charges of running an online cybercrime marketplace active since 2018. He has been charged with five counts of fraudulent use of unauthorized access devices and one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud. If convicted on all counts, Masurica faces a maximum penalty of 55 years in federal prison. He was taken into custody by authorities in Kosovo on December 12, 2024. Masurica is alleged to be the lead administrator of BlackDB.cc from 2018 to the present. ""BlackDB.cc illegally offered for sale compromised account and server credentials, credit card information, and other personally identifiable information of individuals primarily located in the United States,"" the Justice Department said. ""Once purchased, cybercriminals used the items purchased on BlackDB.cc to facilitate a wide range of illegal activity, including tax fraud, credit card fraud, and identity theft.""

Fitzpatrick was sentenced to time served last year, but he went on to violate the terms of his release. He is set to be resentenced next month.
Tor Announces Oniux for Kernel-Level Tor Isolation — The Tor project has announced a new command-line utility called oniux that provides Tor network isolation for third-party applications using Linux namespaces. This effectively creates a fully isolated network environment for each application, preventing data leaks even if the app is malicious or misconfigured. ""Built on Arti, and onionmasq, oniux drop-ships any Linux program into its own network namespace to route it through Tor and strips away the potential for data leaks,"" the Tor project said. ""If your work, activism, or research demands rock-solid traffic isolation, oniux delivers it.""
DoJ Charges 12 More in RICO Conspiracy — The U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against 12 more people for their alleged involvement in a cyber-enabled racketeering conspiracy throughout the United States and abroad that netted them more than $263 million. Several of these individuals are said to have been arrested in the U.S., with two others living in Dubai. They face charges related to RICO conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. The defendants are also accused of stealing over $230 million in cryptocurrency from a victim in Washington D.C. ""The enterprise began no later than October 2023 and continued through March 2025,"" the Justice Department said. ""It grew from friendships developed on online gaming platforms. Members of the enterprise held different responsibilities. The various roles included database hackers, organizers, target identifiers, callers, money launderers, and residential burglars targeting hardware virtual currency wallets."" The attacks involved database hackers breaking into websites and servers to obtain cryptocurrency-related databases or acquiring databases on the dark web. The miscreants then determined the most valuable targets and cold-called them, using social engineering to convince them their accounts were the subject of cyber attacks and that they were helping them take steps to secure their accounts. The end goal of these attacks was to siphon the cryptocurrency assets, which were then laundered and converted into fiat U.S. currency in the form of bulk cash or wire transfers. The money was then used to fund a lavish lifestyle for the defendants. ""Following his arrest in September 2024 and continuing while in pretrial detention, Lam is alleged to have continued working with members of the enterprise to pass and receive directions, collect stolen cryptocurrency, and have enterprise members buy luxury Hermes Birkin bags and hand-deliver them to his girlfriend in Miami, Florida,"" the agency said.
ENISA Launches EUVD Vulnerability Database — The European Union launched a new vulnerability database called the European Vulnerability Database (EUVD) to provide aggregated information regarding security issues affecting various products and services. ""The database provides aggregated, reliable, and actionable information such as mitigation measures and exploitation status on cybersecurity vulnerabilities affecting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) products and services,"" the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) said. The development comes in the wake of uncertainty over MITRE's CVE program in the U.S., after which the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) stepped in at the last minute to extend their contract with MITRE for another 11 months to keep the initiative running.
3 Information Stealers Detected in the Wild — Cybersecurity researchers have exposed the workings of three different information stealer malware families, codenamed DarkCloud Stealer, Chihuahua Stealer, and Pentagon Stealer, that are capable of extracting sensitive data from compromised hosts. While DarkCloud has been advertised in hacking forums as early as January 2023, attacks distributing the malware have primarily focused on government organizations since late January 2025. DarkCloud is distributed as AutoIt payloads via phishing emails using PDF purchase order lures that display a message claiming their Adobe Flash Player is out of date. Chihuahua Stealer, on the other hand, is a .NET-based malware that employs an obfuscated PowerShell script shared through a malicious Google Drive document. First discovered in March 2025, Pentagon Stealer makes use of Golang to realize its goals. However, a Python variant of the same stealer was detected at least a year prior when it was propagated via fake Python packages uploaded to the PyPI repository.
Kaspersky Outlines Malware Trends for Industrial Systems in Q1 2025 — Kaspersky revealed that the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked in Q1 2025 remained unchanged from Q4 2024 at 21.9%. ""Regionally, the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked ranged from 10.7% in Northern Europe to 29.6% in Africa,"" the Russian security company said. ""The biometrics sector led the ranking of the industries and OT infrastructures surveyed in this report in terms of the percentage of ICS computers on which malicious objects were blocked."" The primary categories of detected malicious objects included malicious scripts and phishing pages, denylisted internet resources, and backdoors, and keyloggers.
Linux Flaws Surge by 967% in 2024 — The number of newly discovered Linux and macOS vulnerabilities increased dramatically in 2024, rising by 967% and 95% in 2024. The year was also marked by a 96% jump in exploited vulnerabilities from 101 in 2023 to 198 in 2024, and an unprecedented 37% rise in critical flaws across key enterprise applications. ""The total number of software vulnerabilities grew by 61% YoY in 2024, with critical vulnerabilities rising by 37.1% – a significant expansion of the global attack surface and exposure of critical weaknesses across diverse software categories,"" Action1 said. ""Exploits spiked 657% in browsers and 433% in Microsoft Office, with Chrome leading all products in known attacks."" But in a bit of good news, there was a decrease in remote code execution vulnerabilities for Linux (-85% YoY) and macOS (-44% YoY).
Europol Announces Takedown of Fake Trading Platform — Law enforcement authorities have disrupted an organized crime group that's assessed to be responsible for defrauding more than 100 victims of over €3 million ($3.4 million) through a fake online investment platform. The effort, a joint exercise conducted by Germany, Albania, Cyprus, and Israel, has also led to the arrest of a suspect in Cyprus. ""The criminal network lured victims with the promise of high returns on investments through a fraudulent online trading platform,"" Europol said. ""After the victims made initial smaller deposits, they were pressured to invest larger amounts of money, manipulated by fake charts showing fabricated profits. Criminals posing as brokers used psychological tactics to convince the victims to transfer substantial funds, which were never invested but directly pocketed by the group."" Two other suspects were previously arrested from Latvia in September 2022 as part of the multi-year probe into the criminal network.
New ""defendnot"" Tool Can Disable Windows Defender — A security researcher who goes by the online alias es3n1n has released a tool called ""defendnot"" that can disable Windows Defender by means of a little-known API. ""There's a WSC (Windows Security Center) service in Windows which is used by antiviruses to let Windows know that there's some other antivirus in the hood and it should disable Windows Defender,"" the researcher explained.

Rogue Communication Devices Found in Some Chinese Solar Power Inverters — Reuters reported that U.S. energy officials are reassessing the risk posed by Chinese-made solar power inverters after unexplained communication equipment was found inside some of them. The rogue components are designed to provide additional, undocumented communication channels that could allow firewalls to be circumvented remotely, according to two people familiar with the matter. This could then be used to switch off inverters remotely or change their settings, enabling bad actors to destabilize power grids, damage energy infrastructure, and trigger widespread blackouts. Undocumented communication devices, including cellular radios, have also been found in some batteries from multiple Chinese suppliers, the report added.
Israel Arrest Suspect Behind 2022 Nomad Bridge Crypto Hack — Israeli authorities have arrested and approved the extradition of a Russian-Israeli dual national Alexander Gurevich over his alleged involvement in the Nomad Bridge hack in August 2022 that allowed hackers to steal $190 million. Gurevich is said to have conspired with others to execute an exploit for the bridge's Replica smart contract and launder the resulting proceeds through a sophisticated, multi-layered operation involving privacy coins, mixers, and offshore financial entities. ""Gurevich played a central role in laundering a portion of the stolen funds. Blockchain analysis shows that wallets linked to Gurevich received stolen assets within hours of the bridge breach and began fragmenting the funds across multiple blockchains,"" TRM Labs said. ""He then employed a classic mixer stack: moving assets through Tornado Cash on Ethereum, then converting ETH to privacy coins such as Monero (XMR) and Dash.""
Using V8 Browser Exploits to Bypass WDAC — Researchers have uncovered a sophisticated technique that leverages vulnerable versions of the V8 JavaScript engine to bypass Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC). ""The attack scenario is a familiar one: bring along a vulnerable but trusted binary, and abuse the fact that it is trusted to gain a foothold on the system,"" IBM X-Force said. ""In this case, we use a trusted Electron application with a vulnerable version of V8, replacing main.js with a V8 exploit that executes stage 2 as the payload, and voila, we have native shellcode execution. If the exploited application is whitelisted/signed by a trusted entity (such as Microsoft) and would normally be allowed to run under the employed WDAC policy, it can be used as a vessel for the malicious payload."" The technique builds upon previous findings that make it possible to sidestep WDAC policies by backdooring trusted Electron applications. Last month, CerberSec detailed another method that employs WinDbg Preview to get around WDAC policies.

DevSecOps Is Broken — This Fix Connects Code to Cloud to SOC#

Modern applications don't live in one place—they span code, cloud, and runtime. Yet security is still siloed. This webinar shows why securing just the code isn't enough. You'll learn how unifying AppSec, cloud, and SOC teams can close critical gaps, reduce response times, and stop attacks before they spread. If you're still treating dev, infra, and operations as separate problems, it's time to rethink.
🔧 Cybersecurity Tools#

Qtap → It is a lightweight eBPF tool for Linux that shows what data is being sent and received—before or after encryption—without changing your apps or adding proxies. It runs with minimal overhead and captures full context like process, user, and container info. Useful for auditing, debugging, or analyzing app behavior when source code isn't available.
Checkov → It is a fast, open-source tool that scans infrastructure-as-code and container packages for misconfigurations, exposed secrets, and known vulnerabilities. It supports Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and more—using built-in security policies and Sigma-style rules to catch issues early in the development process.
TrailAlerts → It is a lightweight, serverless AWS-native tool that gives you full control over CloudTrail detections using Sigma rules—without needing a SIEM. It's ideal for teams who want to write, version, and manage their own alert logic as code, but find CloudWatch rules too limited or complex. Built entirely on AWS services like Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB, TrailAlerts lets you detect suspicious activity, correlate events, and send alerts through SNS or SES—without managing infrastructure or paying for unused capacity.

🔒 Tip of the Week#
Catch Hidden Threats in Files Users Trust Too Much → Hackers are using a quiet but dangerous trick: hiding malicious code inside files that look safe — like desktop shortcuts, installer files, or web links. These aren't classic malware files. Instead, they run trusted apps like PowerShell or curl in the background, using basic user actions (like opening a file) to silently infect systems. These attacks often go undetected because the files seem harmless, and no exploits are used — just misuse of normal features.
To detect this, focus on behavior. For example, .desktop files in Linux that run hidden shell commands, .lnk files in Windows launching PowerShell or remote scripts, or macOS .app files silently calling terminal tools. These aren't rare anymore — attackers know defenders often ignore these paths. They're especially dangerous because they don't need admin rights and are easy to hide in shared folders or phishing links.
You can spot these threats using free tools and simple rules. On Windows, use Sysmon and Sigma rules to alert on .lnk files starting PowerShell or suspicious child processes from explorer.exe. On Linux or macOS, use grep or find to scan .desktop and .plist files for odd execution patterns. To test your defenses, simulate these attack paths using MITRE CALDERA — it's free and lets you safely model real-world attacker behavior. Focusing on these overlooked execution paths can close a major gap attackers rely on every day.
Conclusion#
The headlines may be over, but the work isn't. Whether it's rechecking assumptions, prioritizing patches, or updating your response playbooks, the right next step is rarely dramatic—but always decisive. Choose one, and move with intent."

As businesses rush to build in the cloud, security often lags behind. Teams scan code in isolation, react late to cloud threats, and monitor SOC alerts only after damage is done.
Attackers don't wait. They exploit vulnerabilities within hours. Yet most organizations take days to respond to critical cloud alerts. That delay isn't just risky—it's an open door.
The problem? Security is split across silos. DevSecOps, CloudSec, and SOC teams all work separately. Their tools don't talk. Their data doesn't sync. And in those gaps, 80% of cloud exposures slip through—exploitable, avoidable, and often invisible until it's too late.
This free webinar ,""Breaking Down Security Silos: Why Application Security Must Span from Code to Cloud to SOC,"" shows you how to fix that. Join Ory Segal, Technical Evangelist at Cortex Cloud (Palo Alto Networks), and discover a practical approach to securing your apps from code to cloud to SOC—all in one connected strategy.
You'll learn:

Why code scanning alone isn't enough
Where attackers find your biggest blind spots
How to unify your security tools and teams
How to cut response times from days to hours

If you're in AppSec, CloudOps, DevSecOps, or SOC—you'll walk away with insights you can apply immediately.

2025-05-20 02:14:00,"May 16, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/new-httpbot-botnet-launches-200.html,New HTTPBot Botnet Launches 200+ Precision DDoS Attacks on Gaming and Tech Sectors,"Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new botnet malware called HTTPBot that has been used to primarily single out the gaming industry, as well as technology companies and educational institutions in China.
""Over the past few months, it has expanded aggressively, continuously leveraging infected devices to launch external attacks,"" NSFOCUS said in a report published this week. ""By employing highly simulated HTTP Flood attacks and dynamic feature obfuscation techniques, it circumvents traditional rule-based detection mechanisms.""
HTTPBot, first spotted in the wild in August 2024, gets its name from the use of HTTP protocols to launch distributed denial-of-service attacks. Written in Golang, it's something of an anomaly given its targeting of Windows systems.
The Windows-based botnet trojan is noteworthy for its use in precisely targeted attacks aimed at high-value business interfaces such as game login and payment systems.
""This attack with 'scalpel-like' precision poses a systemic threat to industries that rely on real-time interaction,"" the Beijing-headquartered company said. ""HTTPBot marks a paradigm shift in DDoS attacks, moving from 'indiscriminate traffic suppression' to 'high-precision business strangulation.'""
HTTPBot is estimated to have issued no less than 200 attack instructions since the start of April 2025, with the attacks designed to strike the gaming industry, technology companies, educational institutions, and tourism portals in China.

Once installed and run, the malware conceals its graphical user interface (GUI) to sidestep process monitoring by both users and security tools in an effort to increase the stealthiness of the attacks. It also resorts to unauthorized Windows Registry manipulation to ensure that it's run automatically on system startup.
The botnet malware then proceeds to establish contact with a command-and-control (C2) server to await further instructions to execute HTTP flood attacks against specific targets by sending a high volume of HTTP requests. It supports various attack modules -

BrowserAttack, which involves using hidden Google Chrome instances to mimic legitimate traffic while exhausting server resources
HttpAutoAttack, which makes use of a cookie-based approach to accurately simulate legitimate sessions
HttpFpDlAttack, which uses the HTTP/2 protocol and opts for an approach that seeks to increase the CPU loader on the server by coercing it into returning large responses
WebSocketAttack, which uses ""ws://"" and ""wss://"" protocols to establish WebSocket connections
PostAttack, which forces the use of HTTP POST to conduct the attack
CookieAttack, which adds a cookie processing flow based on the BrowserAttack attack method

""DDoS Botnet families tend to congregate on Linux and IoT platforms,"" NSFOCUS said. ""However, the HTTPBot Botnet family has specifically targeted the Windows platform.""
""By deeply simulating protocol layers and mimicking legitimate browser behavior, HTTPBot bypasses defenses that rely on protocol integrity. It also continuously occupies server session resources through randomized URL paths and cookie replenishment mechanisms, rather than relying on sheer traffic volume."""
2025-05-20 02:14:01,"May 16, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/top-10-best-practices-for-effective.html,Top 10 Best Practices for Effective Data Protection,"Data is the lifeblood of productivity, and protecting sensitive data is more critical than ever. With cyber threats evolving rapidly and data privacy regulations tightening, organizations must stay vigilant and proactive to safeguard their most valuable assets. But how do you build an effective data protection framework?
In this article, we'll explore data protection best practices from meeting compliance requirements to streamlining day-to-day operations. Whether you're securing a small business or a large enterprise, these top strategies will help you build a strong defense against breaches and keep your sensitive data safe.
1. Define your data goals#
When tackling any data protection project, the first step is always to understand the outcome you want.
First, understand what data you need to protect. Identify your crown jewel data, and where you THINK it lives. (It's probably more distributed than you expect, but this is a key step to help you define your protection focus.) Work with business owners to find any data outside the typical scope that you need to secure.
This is all to answer the question: ""What data would hurt the company if it were breached?""
Second, work with the C-suit and board of directors to define what your data protection program will look like. Understand your budget, your risk tolerance to data loss, and what resources you have (or may need). Define how aggressive your protection program will be so you can balance risk and productivity. All organizations need to strike a balance between the two.
2. Automate data classification#
Next, begin your data classification journey—that is, find your data and catalog it. This is often the most difficult step in the journey, as organizations create new data all the time.
Your first instinct may be to try to keep up with all your data, but this may be a fool's errand. The key to success is to have classification capabilities everywhere data moves (endpoint, inline, cloud), and rely on your DLP policy to jump in when risk arises. (More on this later.)
Automation in data classification is becoming a lifesaver thanks to the power of AI. AI-powered classification can be faster and more accurate than traditional ways of classifying data with DLP. Ensure any solution you are evaluating can use AI to instantly uncover and discover data without human input.
3. Focus on zero trust security for access control#
Adopting a zero trust architecture is crucial for modern data protection strategies to be effective. Based on the maxim ""never trust, always verify,"" zero trust assumes security threats can come from inside or outside your network. Every access request is authenticated and authorized, greatly reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
Look for a zero trust solution that emphasizes the importance of least-privileged access control between users and apps. With this approach, users never access the network, reducing the ability for threats to move laterally and propagate to other entities and data on the network. The principle of least privilege ensures that users have only the access they need for their roles, reducing the attack surface. 
4. Centralize DLP for consistent alerting#
Data loss prevention (DLP) technology is the core of any data protection program. That said, keep in mind that DLP is only a subset of a larger data protection solution. DLP enables the classification of data (along with AI) to ensure you can accurately find sensitive data. Ensure your DLP engine can consistently alert correctly on the same piece of data across devices, networks, and clouds.
The best way to ensure this is to embrace a centralized DLP engine that can cover all channels at once. Avoid point products that bring their own DLP engine (endpoint, network, CASB), as this can lead to multiple alerts on one piece of moving data, slowing down incident management and response.
Look to embrace Gartner's security service edge approach, which delivers DLP from a centralized cloud service. Focus on vendors that support the most channels so that, as your program grows, you can easily add protection across devices, inline, and cloud.
5. Ensure blocking across key loss channels#
Once you have a centralized DLP, focus on the most important data loss channels to your organization. (You'll need to add more channels as you grow, so ensure your platform can accommodate all of them and grow with you.) The most important channels can vary, but every organization focuses on certain common ones:

Web/Email: The most common ways users accidentally send sensitive data outside the organization.
SaaS data (CASB): Another common loss vector, as users can easily share data externally.
Endpoint: A key focus for many organizations looking to lock down USB, printing, and network shares.
Unmanaged devices/BYOD: If you have a large BYOD footprint, browser isolation is an innovative way to secure data headed to these devices without an agent or VDI. Devices are placed in an isolated browser, which enforces DLP inspection and prevents cut, paste, download, or print. (More on this later.)
SaaS posture control (SSPM/supply chain): SaaS platforms like Microsoft 365 can often be misconfigured. Continuously scanning for gaps and risky third-party integrations is key to minimizing data breaches.
IaaS posture control (DSPM): Most companies have a lot of sensitive data across AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Finding it all, and closing risky misconfigurations that expose it, is the driver behind data security posture management (DSPM).

6. Understand and maintain compliance#
Getting a handle on compliance is a key step for great data protection. You may need to keep up with many different regulations, depending on your industry (GDPR, PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.). These rules are there to make sure personal data is safe and organizations are handling it the right way. Stay informed on the latest mandates to avoid fines and protect your brand, all while building trust with your customers and partners.
To keep on top of compliance, strong data governance practices are a must. This means regular security audits, keeping good records, and making sure your team is well-trained. Embrace technological approaches that help drive better compliance, such as data encryption and monitoring tools. By making compliance part of your routine, you can stay ahead of risks and ensure your data protection is both effective and in line with requirements.
7. Strategize for BYOD#
Although not a concern for every organization, unmanaged devices present a unique challenge for data protection. Your organization doesn't own or have agents on these devices, so you can't ensure their security posture or patch level, wipe them remotely, and so on. Yet their users (like partners or contractors) often have legitimate reasons to access your critical data.
You don't want sensitive data to land on a BYOD endpoint and vanish from your sight. Until now, solutions to secure BYOD have revolved around CASB reverse proxies (problematic) and VDI approaches (expensive).
Browser isolation provides an effective and eloquent way to secure data without the cost and complexity of those approaches. By placing BYOD endpoints in an isolated browser (part of the security service edge), you can enforce great data protection without an endpoint agent. Data is streamed to the device as pixels, allowing interaction with the data but preventing download and cut/paste. You can also apply DLP inspection to the session and data based on your policy.
8. Control your cloud posture with SSPM and DSPM#
Cloud posture is one of the most commonly overlooked aspects of data hygiene. SaaS platforms and public clouds have many settings that DevOps teams without security expertise can easily overlook. The resulting misconfigurations can lead to dangerous gaps that expose sensitive data. Many of the largest data breaches in history have happened because such gaps let adversaries walk right in.
SaaS security posture management (SSPM) and data security posture management (DSPM for IaaS) are designed to uncover and help remediate these risks. By leveraging API access, SSPM and DSPM can continuously scan your cloud deployment, locate sensitive data, identify misconfigurations, and remediate exposures. Some SSPM approaches also feature integrated compliance with frameworks like NIST, ISO, and SOC 2.
9. Don't forget about data security training#
Data security training is often where data protection programs fall apart. If users don't understand or support your data protection goals, dissent can build across your teams and derail your program. Spend time building a training program that highlights your objectives and the value data protection will bring the organization. Ensure upper management supports and sponsors your data security training initiatives.
Some solutions offer built-in user coaching with incident management workflows. This valuable feature allows you to notify users about incidents via Slack or email for justification, education, and policy adjustment if needed. Involving users in their incidents helps promote awareness of data protection practices as well as how to identify and safely handle sensitive content.
10. Automate incident management and workflows#
Lastly, no data protection program would be complete without day-to-day operations. Ensuring your team can efficiently manage and quickly respond to incidents is critical. One way to ensure streamlined processes is to embrace a solution that enables workflow automation.
Designed to automate common incident management and response tasks, this feature can be a lifesaver for IT teams. By saving time and money while improving response times, IT teams can do more with less. Look for solutions that have a strong workflow automation offering integrated into the SSE to make incident management efficient and centralized.
Bringing it all together#
Data protection is not a one-time project; it's an ongoing commitment. Staying informed of data protection best practices will help you build a resilient defense against evolving threats and ensure your organization's long-term success.
Remember: investing in data protection is not just about mitigating risks and preventing data breaches. It's also about building trust, maintaining your reputation, and unlocking new opportunities for growth.

2025-05-20 02:14:03,"May 16, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/researchers-expose-new-intel-cpu-flaws.html,Researchers Expose New Intel CPU Flaws Enabling Memory Leaks and Spectre v2 Attacks,"Researchers at ETH Zürich have discovered yet another security flaw that they say impacts all modern Intel CPUs and causes them to leak sensitive data from memory, showing that the vulnerability known as Spectre continues to haunt computer systems after more than seven years.
The vulnerability, referred to as Branch Privilege Injection (BPI), ""can be exploited to misuse the prediction calculations of the CPU (central processing unit) in order to gain unauthorized access to information from other processor users,"" ETH Zurich said.
Kaveh Razavi, head of the Computer Security Group (COMSEC) and one of the authors of the study, said the shortcoming affects all Intel processors, potentially enabling bad actors to read the contents of the processor's cache and the working memory of another user of the same CPU.

The attack leverages what's called Branch Predictor Race Conditions (BPRC) that emerge when a processor switches between prediction calculations for two users with different permissions, opening the door to a scenario where an unprivileged hacker could exploit it to bypass security barriers and access confidential information from a privileged process.
Intel has issued microcode patches to address the vulnerability, which has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-45332 (CVSS v4 score: 5.7).
""Exposure of sensitive information caused by shared microarchitectural predictor state that influences transient execution in the indirect branch predictors for some Intel Processors may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access,"" Intel said in an advisory released on May 13.
The disclosure comes as researchers from the Systems and Network Security Group (VUSec) at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam detailed a category of self-training Spectre v2 attacks codenamed Training Solo.
""Attackers can speculatively hijack control flow within the same domain (e.g., kernel) and leak secrets across privilege boundaries, re-enabling classic Spectre v2 scenarios without relying on powerful sandboxed environments like eBPF,"" VUSec said.

The hardware exploits, tracked as CVE-2024-28956 and CVE-2025-24495, can be used against Intel CPUs to leak kernel memory at up to 17 Kb/s, with the study finding that they could ""completely break the domain isolation and re-enable traditional user-user, guest-guest, and even guest-host Spectre-v2 attacks.""

CVE-2024-28956 (CVSS v4 score: 5.7) - Indirect Target Selection (ITS), which affects Intel Core 9th-11th, and Intel Xeon 2nd-3rd, among others.
CVE-2025-24495 (CVSS v4 score: 6.8) - Lion Cove BPU issue, which affects Intel CPUs with Lion Cove core

While Intel has shipped microcode updates for these defects, AMD said it has revised its existing guidance on Spectre and Meltdown to explicitly highlight the risk from the use of classic Berkeley Packet Filter (cBPF)."
2025-05-20 02:14:05,"May 16, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/fileless-remcos-rat-delivered-via-lnk.html,Fileless Remcos RAT Delivered via LNK Files and MSHTA in PowerShell-Based Attacks,"Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a new malware campaign that makes use of a PowerShell-based shellcode loader to deploy a remote access trojan called Remcos RAT.
""Threat actors delivered malicious LNK files embedded within ZIP archives, often disguised as Office documents,"" Qualys security researcher Akshay Thorve said in a technical report. ""The attack chain leverages mshta.exe for proxy execution during the initial stage.""
The latest wave of attacks, as detailed by Qualys, employs tax-related lures to entice users into opening a malicious ZIP archive containing a Windows shortcut (LNK) file, which, in turn, makes use of mshta.exe, a legitimate Microsoft tool used to run HTML Applications (HTA).
The binary is used to execute an obfuscated HTA file named ""xlab22.hta"" hosted on a remote server, which incorporates Visual Basic Script code to download a PowerShell script, a decoy PDF, and another HTA file similar to xlab22.hta called ""311.hta."" The HTA file is also configured to make Windows Registry modifications to ensure that ""311.hta"" is automatically launched upon system startup.
Once the PowerShell script is executed, it decodes and reconstructs a shellcode loader that ultimately proceeds to launch the Remcos RAT payload entirely in memory.
Remcos RAT is a well-known malware that offers threat actors full control over compromised systems, making it an ideal tool for cyber espionage and data theft. A 32-bit binary compiled using Visual Studio C++ 8, it features a modular structure and can gather system metadata, log keystrokes, capture screenshots, monitor clipboard data, and retrieve a list of all installed programs and running processes.

In addition, it establishes a TLS connection to a command-and-control (C2) server at ""readysteaurants[.]com,"" maintaining a persistent channel for data exfiltration and control.
This is not the first time fileless versions of Remcos RAT have been spotted in the wild. In November 2024, Fortinet FortiGuard Labs detailed a phishing campaign that filelessly deployed the malware by making use of order-themed lures.
What makes the attack method attractive to threat actors is that it allows them to operate undetected by many traditional security solutions as the malicious code runs directly in the computer's memory, leaving very few traces on the disk.
""The rise of PowerShell-based attacks like the new Remcos RAT variant demonstrates how threat actors are evolving to evade traditional security measures,"" J Stephen Kowski, Field CTO at SlashNext, said.
""This fileless malware operates directly in memory, using LNK files and MSHTA.exe to execute obfuscated PowerShell scripts that can bypass conventional defenses. Advanced email security that can detect and block malicious LNK attachments before they reach users is crucial, as is real-time scanning of PowerShell commands for suspicious behaviors.""

The disclosure comes as Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 and Threatray detailed a new .NET loader that's used to detonate a wide range of commodity information stealers and RATS like Agent Tesla, NovaStealer, Remcos RAT, VIPKeylogger, XLoader, and XWorm.
The loader features three stages that work in tandem to deploy the final-stage payload: A .NET executable that embeds the second and third stages in encrypted form, a .NET DLL that decrypts and loads the next stage, and a .NET DLL that manages the deployment of the main malware.
""While earlier versions embedded the second stage as a hardcoded string, more recent versions use a bitmap resource,"" Threatray said. ""The first stage extracts and decrypts this data, then executes it in memory to launch the second stage.""
Unit 42 described the use of bitmap resources to conceal malicious payloads a a steganography technique that can bypass traditional security mechanisms and evade detection.
The findings also coincide with the emergence of several phishing and social engineering campaigns that are engineered for credential theft and malware delivery -

Use of trojanized versions of the KeePass password management software – codenamed KeeLoader – to drop a Cobalt Strike beacon and steal sensitive KeePass database data, including administrative credentials. The malicious installers are hosted on KeePass typosquat domains that are served via Bing ads.
Use of ClickFix lures and URLs embedded within PDF documents and a series of intermediary dropper URLs to deploy Lumma Stealer.
Use of booby-trapped Microsoft Office documents that are used to deploy the Formbook information stealer protected using a malware distribution service referred to as Horus Protector.
Use of blob URIs to locally loads a credential phishing page via phishing emails, with the blob URIs served using allow-listed pages (e.g., onedrive.live[.]com) that are abused to redirect victims to a malicious site that contains a link to a threat actor-controlled HTML page.
Use of RAR archives masquerading as setup files to distribute NetSupport RAT in attacks targeting Ukraine and Poland.
Use of phishing emails to distribute HTML attachments that contain malicious code to capture victims' Outlook, Hotmail, and Gmail credentials and exfiltrate them to a Telegram bot named ""Blessed logs"" that has been active since February 2025


The developments have also been complemented by the rise in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered campaigns that leverage polymorphic tricks that mutate in real-time to sidestep detection efforts. These include modifying email subject lines, sender names, and body content to slip past signature-based detection.
""AI gave threat actors the power to automate malware development, scale attacks across industries, and personalize phishing messages with surgical precision,"" Cofense said.
""These evolving threats are increasingly able to bypass traditional email filters, highlighting the failure of perimeter-only defenses and the need for post-delivery detection. It also enabled them to outmaneuver traditional defenses through polymorphic phishing campaigns that shift content on the fly. The result: deceptive messages that are increasingly difficult to detect and even harder to stop."""

User Data From May 27 Without Consent; Noyb Threatens Lawsuit,"Austrian privacy non-profit noyb (none of your business) has sent Meta's Irish headquarters a cease-and-desist letter, threatening the company with a class action lawsuit if it proceeds with its plans to train users' data for training its artificial intelligence (AI) models without an explicit opt-in.
The move comes weeks after the social media behemoth announced its plans to train its AI models using public data shared by adults across Facebook and Instagram in the European Union (E.U.) starting May 27, 2025, after it paused the efforts in June 2024 following concerns raised by Irish data protection authorities.
""Instead of asking consumers for opt-in consent, Meta relies on an alleged 'legitimate interest' to just suck up all user data,"" noyb said in a statement. ""Meta may face massive legal risks – just because it relies on an 'opt-out' instead of an 'opt-in' system for AI training.""

The advocacy group further noted that Meta AI is not compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the region, and that, besides claiming that it has a ""legitimate interest"" in taking user data for AI training, the company is also limiting the right to opt-out before the training has started.
Noyb also pointed out that even if 10% of Meta's users expressly agree to hand over the data for this purpose, it would amount to enough data points for the company to learn E.U. languages.
It's worth pointing out that Meta previously claimed that it needed to collect this information to capture the diverse languages, geography, and cultural references of the region.
""Meta starts a huge fight just to have an opt-out system instead of an opt-in system,"" noyb's Max Schrems said. ""Instead, they rely on an alleged 'legitimate interest' to just take the data and run with it. This is neither legal nor necessary.""
""Meta's absurd claims that stealing everyone's personal data is necessary for AI training is laughable. Other AI providers do not use social network data – and generate even better models than Meta.""
The privacy group also accused the company of moving ahead with its plans by putting the onus on users and pointed out that national data protection authorities have largely stayed silent on the legality of AI training without consent.
""It therefore seems that Meta simply moved ahead anyways – taking another huge legal risk in the E.U. and trampling over users' rights,"" noyb added.
In a statement shared with Reuters, Meta has rejected noyb's arguments, stating they are wrong on the facts and the law, and that it has provided E.U. users with a ""clear"" option to object to their data being processed for AI training.

This is not the first time Meta's reliance on GDPR's ""legitimate interest"" to collect data without explicit opt-in consent has come under scrutiny. In August 2023, the company agreed to change the legal basis from ""legitimate interest"" to a consent-based approach to process user data for serving targeted ads for people in the region.
The disclosure comes as the Belgian Court of Appeal ruled the Transparency and Consent Framework, used by Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and other companies to obtain consent for data processing for personalized advertising purposes, is illegal across Europe, citing violation of several principles of GDPR laws."

""Criminals targeted our customer support agents overseas,"" the company said in a statement. ""They used cash offers to convince a small group of insiders to copy data in our customer support tools for less than 1% of Coinbase monthly transacting users.""
The end goal of the campaign was to put together a list of customers who they contacted by masquerading as Coinbase and deceiving them into handing over their cryptocurrency assets.

Coinbase said the threat actors then unsuccessfully attempted to extort the company for $20 million on May 11, 2025, by claiming to have information about certain customer accounts as well as internal documents. In a statement shared with Fortune, Coinbase said the compromised customer agents worked in India and have all been fired.

Limited corporate data, including documents, training material, and communications available to support agents

The crypto giant said it's taking the step of reimbursing customers who were tricked into transferring funds to the attacker due to social engineering attacks. It's exactly not clear how many customers fell for the scam, but the company told TechCrunch that less than 1% of its 9.7 million monthly customers were affected.

The company is also enforcing added ID checks for certain flagged accounts when carrying out large withdrawals, and that it's hardening its defenses to counter such insider threats. Lastly, Coinbase has established a $20 million reward fund for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the attackers.
As mitigations, users are advised to turn on withdrawal allow‑listing to permit transfers only to addresses in their address books, enable two-factor authentication (2FA), and be cautious about imposters who try to move funds to a safe wallet.
Update#
Coinbase, in a statement shared with Bloomberg, said it began observing unusual activity from some of these customer representatives as far back as January. The threat actors are also said to have bribed enough customer service agents to achieve ""effectively on-demand access to Coinbase customer information"" over the past five months, a claim Coinbase has disputed.
""What these attackers were doing was finding Coinbase employees and contractors based in India who were associated with our business process outsourcing or support operations, that kind of thing, and bribing them in order to obtain customer data,"" Coinbase Chief Security Officer Philip Martin was quoted as saying.
""So there were a number of specific bribery incidents that this attack, that this threat actor is claiming credit for throughout the course of that time, but they did not have persistent access over the course of the entire period."""
2025-05-20 02:14:10,"May 15, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/pen-testing-for-compliance-only-its.html,Pen Testing for Compliance Only? It's Time to Change Your Approach,"Imagine this: Your organization completed its annual penetration test in January, earning high marks for security compliance. In February, your development team deployed a routine software update. By April, attackers had already exploited a vulnerability introduced in that February update, gaining access to customer data weeks before being finally detected.
This situation isn't theoretical: it plays out repeatedly as organizations realize that point-in-time compliance testing can't protect against vulnerabilities introduced after the assessment. According to Verizons 2025 Data Breach Investigation Report, the exploitation of vulnerabilities rose 34% year-over-year. While compliance frameworks provide important security guidelines, companies need continuous security validation to identify and remediate new vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. 
Here's what you need to know about pen testing to meet compliance standards — and why you should adopt continuous penetration testing, if your penetration testing goals go beyond minimum standards.
The current state of pen testing#
Compliance-driven pen testing#
If your organization is like many, you might conduct penetration tests primarily to satisfy regulatory frameworks like PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC 2, or ISO 27001. But if your pen testing focuses on simply checking off compliance boxes — instead of developing comprehensive security postures — you're creating a dangerous disconnect between security theater and actual threat protection. 
Limitations#
Compliance-focused pen testing has several limitations that leave organizations vulnerable.

Surface-level security: Compliance-focused penetration testing typically addresses only compliance-relevant vulnerabilities. If your organization focuses its pen testing exclusively on meeting compliance requirements, you're just scratching the surface — and missing the chance to identify vulnerabilities that fall outside the scope of regulatory frameworks. These undetected weaknesses can give attackers an attack vector into your systems, potentially leading to devastating data breaches and operational disruptions.
Static nature: Cyber attackers and the digital landscape move fast. Compliance standards? Not so much. During the months (or years) it takes for regulatory frameworks to catch up with new threats – and the gaps between compliance-focused penetration tests – malicious actors are actively developing exploits for emerging vulnerabilities. By the time these weaknesses appear on compliance checklists, attackers may have already compromised countless systems.
False sense of security: Organizations often mistake compliance for security, believing a passing audit score means they're sufficiently protected. But the reality is that compliance certifications represent minimum standards that sophisticated attackers can easily bypass. Companies with successful audits may lower their guard when they should be working on strengthening their defenses beyond basic requirements.

The importance of continuous pen testing#
Embracing continuous security testing offers organizations numerous benefits.

Beyond compliance: Proactive and continuous penetration testing can reveal vulnerabilities that scheduled compliance checks might miss. Skilled human testers can uncover complex security flaws in business logic, authentication systems, and data flows, while automated scans keep an eye on any changes that might happen over the development cycle. By implementing regular, comprehensive testing, your organization can stay ahead of attackers rather than merely satisfying auditors. You'll be doing much more than passing the next compliance review — you'll be developing a resilient security posture capable of withstanding more sophisticated threats.
Continuous improvement: Security threats constantly change, forcing organizations to adopt ongoing testing instead of point-in-time assessments. And regular penetration tests can expose vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them. For example, Pen Testing as a Service (PTaaS) helps organizations achieve continuous security validation without overwhelming internal teams. With PTaaS, your organization can detect new threats in time and quickly take steps to remediate them. Instead of reacting to breaches after they occur, PTaaS lets you stay a step ahead of attackers by using real-world testing to continuously strengthen your security.

Key components of a pen testing strategy with security in mind#
To implement penetration testing that truly helps safeguard your systems, focus on these key strategic components:
Regular or continuous testing#
To effectively address vulnerabilities in real time, your organization should regularly conduct penetration tests — including after significant system changes and before major deployments. Ultimately, your ideal pen testing frequency and depth will depend on your assets — their complexity, criticality to your business operations and external exposure. 
For example, if you have an online store that holds critical customer data and payment information — and is regularly updated with changes and plugins — you may want to employ continuous testing. On the other end of the spectrum, your marketing department's fall-campaign microsite may only need quarterly or annual assessments.
Integration with other security measures#
Want to maximize your organization's security effectiveness? Combine penetration testing with External Attack Surface Management (EASM). By identifying your digital footprint and testing critical applications based on the latest threat data, your team can prioritize high-risk vulnerabilities while ensuring no internet-facing assets remain unmonitored, unprotected or untested.
Customization and threat-led penetration tests#
Your organization faces unique security challenges based on your industry, technology stack, and business operations. By tailoring penetration testing, you can focus on your business's specific threat profile — testing the areas where breaches are most likely to occur based on the most active threat actors and those that would cause the most damage — rather than wasting time and resources on cookie-cutter assessments.
Overcoming challenges#
Despite the clear benefits, many organizations struggle with common penetration testing implementation challenges related to resources and culture.
Resource allocation#
Resource issues — including budget constraints and shortage of qualified security personnel — prevent many organizations from implementing adequate penetration testing programs. But PTaaS and combined discovery and testing services like Outpost24s CyberFlex service solve these challenges by providing access to certified testers through a predictable subscription model, eliminating budget spikes and the expense of maintaining specialized in-house expertise.
Cultural shift#
To move beyond compliance-driven security, your organization's leadership must champion a cultural shift prioritizing continuous testing and proactive risk management. When security becomes embedded in your organizational culture, pen testing transforms from a periodic checklist item into an ongoing process of discovering and addressing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
Taking action with integrated solutions#
For the greatest level of security, your organization must know every application in your environment and test each one thoroughly. And a combined solution like Outpost24's CyberFlex can help. Integrating EASM and PTaaS on a platform level, allows cybersecurity experts to identify all internet-facing applications, use detailed categorizations to prioritize risks, and test business-critical applications with flexible, human-led assessments. By shifting to proactive penetration testing, your organization can prevent attacks before they happen — and satisfy compliance requirements.

The high-severity vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-4664 (CVSS score: 4.3), has been characterized as a case of insufficient policy enforcement in a component called Loader.
""Insufficient policy enforcement in Loader in Google Chrome prior to 136.0.7103.113 allowed a remote attacker to leak cross-origin data via a crafted HTML page,"" according to a description of the flaw.
The tech giant credited security researcher Vsevolod Kokorin (@slonser_) with detailing the flaw in X on May 5, 2025, adding it's aware ""an exploit for CVE-2025-4664 exists in the wild.""

""Unlike other browsers, Chrome resolves the Link header on sub-resource requests,"" Kokorin said in a series of posts on X earlier this month. ""The issue is that the Link header can set a referrer-policy. We can specify unsafe-url and capture the full query parameters.""
The researcher went on to add that query parameters can contain sensitive data that can lead to a full account takeover and that the query parameter information can be stolen via an image from a third-party resource.
It's not clear if the vulnerability was exploited in a malicious context outside of this proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstration. CVE-2025-4664 is the second vulnerability after CVE-2025-2783 to have come under ""active exploitation"" in the wild.
To safeguard against potential threats, it's advised to update their Chrome browser to versions 136.0.7103.113/.114 for Windows and Mac, and 136.0.7103.113 for Linux. Users of other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi are also advised to apply the fixes as and when they become available. 
Update#
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on Thursday, added CVE-2025-4664 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by June 5, 2025."
2025-05-20 02:14:16,"May 15, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/top-5-bcdr-capabilities-for-ransomware-defense.html,5 BCDR Essentials for Effective Ransomware Defense,"Ransomware has evolved into a deceptive, highly coordinated and dangerously sophisticated threat capable of crippling organizations of any size. Cybercriminals now exploit even legitimate IT tools to infiltrate networks and launch ransomware attacks. In a chilling example, Microsoft recently disclosed how threat actors misused its Quick Assist remote assistance tool to deploy the destructive Black Basta ransomware strain. And what’s worse? Innovations like Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) are lowering the bar for entry, making ransomware attacks more frequent and far-reaching than ever before. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, by 2031, a new ransomware attack is expected every 2 seconds, with projected damages hitting an astronomical $275 billion annually.
No organization is immune to ransomware, and building a strong recovery strategy is equally, if not even more, important than attempting to prevent all attacks in the first place. A solid business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy can be your last and most critical line of defense when ransomware breaks through, allowing you to bounce back quickly from the attack, resume operations and avoid paying ransom. Notably, the cost of investing in BCDR is negligible compared to the devastation that prolonged downtime or data loss can cause.
In this article, we’ll break down the five essential BCDR capabilities you should have in place to effectively recover from ransomware. These strategies can mean the difference between swift recovery and business failure after an attack. Let’s explore what every organization must do before it’s too late.
Follow the 3-2-1 (and then some!) backup rule#

The 3-2-1 backup rule has long been the gold standard: keep three copies of your data, store them on two different media and keep one copy off-site. But in the age of ransomware, that’s no longer enough.
Experts now recommend the 3-2-1-1-0 strategy. The extra 1 stands for one immutable copy — a backup that can’t be changed or deleted. The 0 represents zero doubt in your ability to recover, with verified, tested recovery points.
Why the upgrade? Ransomware doesn’t just target production systems anymore. It actively seeks and encrypts backups as well. That’s why isolation, immutability and verification are key. Cloud-based and air-gapped backup storage provide essential layers of protection, keeping backups out of reach from threats that even use stolen admin credentials.
Having such immutable backups ensures recovery points remain untampered, no matter what. They’re your safety net when everything else is compromised. Plus, this level of data protection helps meet rising cyber insurance standards and compliance obligations.
Bonus tip: Look for solutions offering a hardened Linux architecture to camouflage and isolate backups outside of the common Windows attack surface.
Automate and monitor backups continuously#
Automation is powerful, but without active monitoring, it can become your biggest blind spot. While scheduling backups and automating verification saves time, it’s just as important to ensure that those backups are actually happening and that they’re usable.
Use built-in tools or custom scripting to monitor backup jobs, trigger alerts on failures and verify the integrity of your recovery points. It’s simple: either monitor continuously or risk finding out too late that your backups never had your back. Regularly testing and validating the recovery points is the only way to trust your recovery plan.
Bonus tip: Choose solutions that integrate with professional services automation (PSA) ticketing systems to automatically raise alerts and tickets for any backup hiccups.
Protect your backup infrastructure from ransomware and internal threats#
Your backup infrastructure must be isolated, hardened and tightly controlled to prevent unauthorized access or tampering. You must:

Lock down your backup network environment.
Host your backup server in a secure local area network (LAN) segment with no inbound internet access. 
Allow outbound communication from the backup server only to approved vendor networks. Block all unapproved outbound traffic using strict firewall rules.
Permit communication only between protected systems and the backup server.
Use firewalls and port-based access control lists (ACLs) on network switches to enforce granular access control.
Apply agent-level encryption so data is protected at rest, using keys generated from a secure passphrase only you control.
Enforce strict access controls and authentication.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) with least-privilege roles for Tier 1 techs.
Ensure multifactor authentication (MFA) for all access to the backup management console.
Monitor audit logs continuously for privilege escalations or unauthorized role changes.
Ensure audit logs are immutable.

Review regularly for:

Security-related events like failed logins, privilege escalations, deletion of backups and device removal.
Administrative actions such as changes to backup schedules, changes to retention settings, new user creation and changes to user roles.
Backup and backup copy (replication) success/failure rates and backup verification success/failure rates.
Stay alert to serious risks.
Configure automatic alerts for policy violations and high-severity security events, such as an unauthorized change to backup retention policies.

Test restores regularly and include them in your DR plan#
Backups mean nothing if you can’t restore from them quickly and completely, and that’s why regular testing is essential. Recovery drills must be scheduled and integrated into your disaster recovery (DR) plan. The goal is to build muscle memory, reveal weaknesses and confirm that your recovery plan actually works under pressure.
Start by defining the recovery time objective (RTO) and the recovery point objective (RPO) for every system. These determine how fast and how recent your recoverable data needs to be. Testing against those targets helps ensure your strategy aligns with business expectations.
Importantly, don’t limit testing to one type of restore. Simulate file-level recoveries, full bare-metal restores and full-scale cloud failovers. Each scenario uncovers different vulnerabilities, such as time delays, compatibility issues or infrastructure gaps.
Also, recovery is more than a technical task. Involve stakeholders across departments to test communication protocols, role responsibilities and customer-facing impacts. Who talks to clients? Who triggers the internal chain of command? Everyone should know their role when every second counts.
Detect threats early with backup-level visibility#
When it comes to ransomware, speed of detection is everything. While endpoint and network tools often get the spotlight, your backup layer is also a powerful, often overlooked line of defense. Monitoring backup data for anomalies can reveal early signs of ransomware activity, giving you a critical head start before widespread damage occurs.
Backup-level visibility allows you to detect telltale signs like sudden encryption, mass deletions or abnormal file modifications. For example, if a process begins overwriting file contents with random data while leaving all modified timestamps intact, that’s a major red flag. No legitimate program behaves that way. With smart detection at the backup layer, you can catch these behaviors and get alerted immediately.
This capability doesn’t replace your endpoint detection and response (EDR) or antivirus (AV) solutions; it supercharges them. It speeds up triage, helps isolate compromised systems faster and reduces an attack’s overall blast radius.
For maximum impact, choose backup solutions that offer real-time anomaly detection and support integration with your security information and event management (SIEM) or centralized logging systems. The faster you see the threat, the faster you can act — and that can be the difference between a minor disruption and a major disaster.
Bonus tip: Train end users to recognize and report suspicious activity early#
If BCDR is your last line of defense, your end users are the first. Cybercriminals are increasingly targeting end users today. According to Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2024, threat actors are trying to access user credentials through various methods, such as phishing, malware and brute-force/password spray attacks. Over the last year, around 7,000 password attacks were blocked per second in Entra ID alone.
In fact, ransomware attacks often begin with a single click, usually via phishing emails or compromised credentials. Regular security training — especially simulated phishing exercises — helps build awareness of red flags and risky behaviors. Equip your team with the knowledge to spot ransomware warning signs, recognize unsafe data practices and respond appropriately.
Encourage immediate reporting of anything that seems off. Foster a culture of enablement, not blame. When people feel safe to speak up, they’re more likely to take action. You can even take it further by launching internal programs that reward vigilance, such as a Cybersecurity Hero initiative to recognize and celebrate early reporters of potential threats.
Final thoughts#
Ransomware doesn’t have to be feared; it has to be planned for. The five BCDR capabilities we discussed above will equip you to withstand even the most advanced ransomware threats and ensure your organization can recover quickly, completely and confidently.

The activity, which commenced in 2023, has been codenamed Operation RoundPress by the Slovak cybersecurity company. It has been attributed with medium confidence to the Russian state-sponsored hacking group tracked as APT28, which is also referred to as BlueDelta, Fancy Bear, Fighting Ursa, Forest Blizzard, FROZENLAKE, Iron Twilight, ITG05, Pawn Storm, Sednit, Sofacy, and TA422.
""The ultimate goal of this operation is to steal confidential data from specific email accounts,"" ESET researcher Matthieu Faou said in a report shared with The Hacker News. ""Most victims are governmental entities and defense companies in Eastern Europe, although we have observed governments in Africa, Europe, and South America being targeted as well.""
This is not the first time APT28 has been tied to attacks exploiting flaws in webmail software. In June 2023, Recorded Future detailed the threat actor's abuse of multiple flaws in Roundcube (CVE-2020-12641, CVE-2020-35730, and CVE-2021-44026) to conduct reconnaissance and data gathering.

Since then, other threat actors like Winter Vivern and UNC3707 (aka GreenCube) have also targeted email solutions, including Roundcube, in various campaigns over the years. Operation RoundPress' ties to APT28 stem from overlaps in the email address used to send the spear-phishing emails and similarities in the way certain servers were configured.
A majority of the targets of the campaign in 2024 have been found to be Ukrainian governmental entities or defense companies in Bulgaria and Romania, some of which are producing Soviet-era weapons to be sent to Ukraine. Other targets include government, military, and academic organizations in Greece, Cameroon, Ecuador, Serbia, and Cyprus.
The attacks entail the exploitation of XSS vulnerabilities in Horde, MDaemon, and Zimbra to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the webmail window. It's worth noting that CVE-2023-43770, an XSS bug in Roundcube, was added by the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog in February 2024.

While the attacks targeting Horde (an unspecified old flaw fixed in Horde Webmail 1.0 released in 2007), Roundcube (CVE-2023-43770), and Zimbra (CVE-2024-27443) leveraged security defects already known and patched, the MDaemon XSS vulnerability is assessed to have been used by the threat actor as a zero-day. Assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2024-11182 (CVSS score: 5.3), it was patched in version 24.5.1 last November.
""Sednit sends these XSS exploits by email,"" Faou said. ""The exploits lead to the execution of malicious JavaScript code in the context of the webmail client web page running in a browser window. Therefore, only data accessible from the victim's account can be read and exfiltrated.""
However, for the exploit to be successful, the target must be convinced to open the email message in the vulnerable webmail portal, assuming it's able to bypass the software's spam filters and land on the user's inbox. The contents of the email themselves are innocuous, as the malicious code that triggers the XSS flaw resides within the HTML code of the email message's body and, therefore, is not visible to the user.
Successful exploitation leads to the execution of an obfuscated JavaScript payload named SpyPress that comes with the ability to steal webmail credentials and harvest email messages and contact information from the victim's mailbox. The malware, despite lacking a persistence mechanism, gets reloaded every time the booby-trapped email message is opened.

""In addition, we detected a few SpyPress.ROUNDCUBE payloads that have the ability to create Sieve rules,"" ESET said. ""SpyPress.ROUNDCUBE creates a rule that will send a copy of every incoming email to an attacker-controlled email address. Sieve rules are a feature of Roundcube and therefore the rule will be executed even if the malicious script is no longer running.""
The gathered information is subsequently exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hard-coded command-and-control (C2) server. Select variants of the malware have also been found to capture login history, two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, and even create an application password for MDAEMON to retain access to the mailbox even if the password or the 2FA code gets changed.
""Over the past two years, webmail servers such as Roundcube and Zimbra have been a major target for several espionage groups such as Sednit, GreenCube, and Winter Vivern,"" Faou said. ""Because many organizations don't keep their webmail servers up to date and because the vulnerabilities can be triggered remotely by sending an email message, it is very convenient for attackers to target such servers for email theft."""

""This campaign employs clever Unicode-based steganography to hide its initial malicious code and utilizes a Google Calendar event short link as a dynamic dropper for its final payload,"" Veracode said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
""Os-info-checker-es6"" was first published in the npm registry on March 19, 2025, by a user named ""kim9123."" It has been downloaded 2,001 times as of writing. The same user has also uploaded another npm package called ""skip-tot"" that lists ""os-info-checker-es6"" as a dependency. The package has been downloaded 94 times.

While the initial five versions exhibited no signs of data exfiltration or malicious behavior, a subsequent iteration uploaded on May 7, 2025, has been found to include obfuscated code in the ""preinstall.js"" file to parse Unicode ""Private Use Access"" characters and extract a next-stage payload.
The malicious code, for its part, is designed to contact a Google Calendar event short link (""calendar.app[.]google/<string>"") with a Base64-encoded string as the title, which decodes to a remote server with the IP address ""140.82.54[.]223."" In other words, Google Calendar is a dead drop resolver to obfuscate the attacker-controlled infrastructure.

However, no additional payloads are distributed at this point. This either indicates that the campaign is either still a work in progress, or currently dormant. Another possibility is that it has already concluded, or that the command-and-control (C2) server is designed to respond only to specific machines that meet certain criteria.
""This use of a legitimate, widely trusted service like Google Calendar as an intermediary to host the next C2 link is a clever tactic to evade detection and make blocking the initial stages of the attack more difficult,"" Veracode said.

The application security company and Aikido, which also detailed the activity, further noted that three other packages have listed ""os-info-checker-es6"" as a dependency, although it's suspected that the dependent packages are part of the same campaign -

vue-dev-serverr
vue-dummyy
vue-bit


""The os-info-checker-es6 package represents a sophisticated and evolving threat within the npm ecosystem,"" Veracode said. ""The attacker demonstrated a progression from apparent testing to deploying a multi-stage malware.""
The disclosure comes as software supply chain security company Socket highlighted typoquatting, Go repository caching abuse, obfuscation, multi-stage execution, slopsquatting, and abuse of legitimate services and developer tools as the six main adversarial techniques adopted by threat actors in the first half of 2025.
""To counter this, defenders must focus on behavioral signals, such as unexpected postinstall scripts, file overwrites, and unauthorized outbound traffic, while validating third-party packages before use,"" security researchers Kirill Boychenko and Philipp Burckhardt said.
""Static and dynamic analysis, version pinning, and close inspection of CI/CD logs are essential to detecting malicious dependencies before they reach production."""

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-4632 (CVSS score: 9.8), has been described as a path traversal flaw.
""Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory vulnerability in Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server version before 21.1052 allows attackers to write arbitrary files as system authority,"" according to an advisory for the flaw.

It's worth noting that CVE-2025-4632 is a patch bypass for CVE-2024-7399, another path traversal flaw in the same product that was remediated by Samsung in August 2024.
CVE-2025-4632 has since been exploited in the wild shortly after the release of a proof-of-concept (PoC) by SSD Disclosure on April 30, 2025, in some instances to even deploy the Mirai botnet.
While it was initially assumed that the attacks were targeting CVE-2024-7399, cybersecurity company Huntress first revealed the existence of an unpatched vulnerability last week after finding signs of exploitation even on MagicINFO 9 Server instances running the latest version (21.1050).
In a follow-up report published on May 9, Huntress revealed three separate incidents that involved the exploitation of CVE-2025-4632, with unidentified actors running an identical set of commands to download additional payloads like ""srvany.exe"" and ""services.exe"" on two hosts and executing reconnaissance commands on the third.
Users of the Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server are recommended to apply the latest fixes as soon as possible to safeguard against potential threats.

""We have verified that MagicINFO 9 21.1052.0 does mitigate the original issue raised in CVE-2025-4632,"" Jamie Levy, director of adversary tactics at Huntress, told The Hacker News.
""Any machine that has versions v8 - v9 21.1050.0 will still be affected by this vulnerability. We've also discovered that upgrading from MagicINFO v8 to v9 21.1052.0 is not as straightforward since you have to first upgrade to 21.1050.0 before applying the final patch."""

Cybersecurity firm ReliaQuest, in a new update published today, said it uncovered evidence suggesting involvement from the BianLian data extortion crew and the RansomExx ransomware family, which is traced by Microsoft under the moniker Storm-2460.
BianLian is assessed to be involved in at least one incident based on infrastructure links to IP addresses previously identified as attributed to the e-crime group.

""We identified a server at 184[.]174[.]96[.]74 hosting reverse proxy services initiated by the rs64.exe executable,"" the company said. ""This server is related to another IP, 184[.]174[.]96[.]70, operated by the same hosting provider. The second IP had previously been flagged as a command-and-control (C2) server associated with BianLian, sharing identical certificates and ports.""
ReliaQuest said it also observed the deployment of a plugin-based trojan dubbed PipeMagic, which was most recently used in connection with the zero-day exploitation of a privilege escalation bug (CVE-2025-29824) in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) in limited attacks targeting entities in the U.S., Venezuela, Spain, and Saudi Arabia.
The attacks involved the delivery of PipeMagic by means of web shells dropped following the exploitation of the SAP NetWeaver flaw.
""Although the initial attempt failed, a subsequent attack involved the deployment of the Brute Ratel C2 framework using inline MSBuild task execution,"" ReliaQuest said. ""During this activity, a dllhost.exe process was spawned, signaling exploitation of the CLFS vulnerability (CVE-2025-29824), which the group had previously exploited, with this being a new attempt to exploit it via inline assembly.""
The findings come a day after EclecticIQ disclosed that multiple Chinese hacking groups tracked as UNC5221, UNC5174, and CL-STA-0048 are actively exploiting CVE-2025-31324 to drop various malicious payloads.
SAP security company Onapsis revealed that threat actors have also been exploiting CVE-2025-31324 alongside a deserialization flaw in the same component (CVE-2025-42999) since March 2025, adding the new patch fixes the root cause of CVE-2025-31324.
""There is little practical difference between CVE-2025-31324 and CVE-2025-42999 as long as CVE-2025-31324 is available for exploitation,"" ReliaQuest said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.
""CVE-2025-42999 indicates higher privileges would be required, however, CVE-2025-31324 affords full system access regardless. A threat actor could exploit both vulnerabilities in an authenticated and unauthenticated user in the same way. Therefore, the remediation advice is the same for both CVEs.""
Update#
In a new analysis, OP Innovate has disclosed that it identified evidence of CVE-2025-31324 (and by extension CVE-2025-42999) being exploited by threat actors tied to the Qilin ransomware operation at least three weeks before details of the bug became public knowledge.
""Weeks before CVE-2025-31324 appeared in public advisories, an attacker exploited the vulnerable Metadata Uploader endpoint within SAP NetWeaver,"" the Israeli company said. ""The attacker uploaded several JSP-based webshells to the SAP IRJ directory.""

The attacker is said to have then initiated outbound communication with Cobalt Strike command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, downloaded a reverse SOCKS5 tunneling tool (""rs64c.exe"") from the IP address 184[.]174[.]96[.]74. Interestingly, the same indicators of compromise have been attributed by ReliaQuest to the BianLian data extortion group.
""The attacker's use of IP address 184[.]174[.]96[.]74 and the tool rs64c.exe closely matches infrastructure and tools previously associated with Qilin, a Russian-speaking ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) group,"" Matan Matalon, CISO and Head of IR at OP Innovate, said.
""In both incidents, the attacker successfully gained initial access and remote code execution by exploiting CVE-2025-31324. However, post-exploitation efforts failed completely in both cases.""
The findings reflect the growing interest in weaponizing high-profile vulnerabilities for financial gain, not to mention a widening of cyber intrusions exploiting the SAP NetWeaver flaw.
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), on Thursday, added CVE-2025-42999 to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by June 5, 2025.

2025-05-20 02:14:27,"May 14, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/xinbi-telegram-market-tied-to-84b-in.html,"Xinbi Telegram Market Tied to $8.4B in Crypto Crime, Romance Scams, North Korea Laundering","A Chinese-language, Telegram-based marketplace called Xinbi Guarantee has facilitated no less than $8.4 billion in transactions since 2022, making it the second major black market to be exposed after HuiOne Guarantee.
According to a report published by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, merchants on the marketplace have been found to peddle technology, personal data, and money laundering services.
""The USDT stablecoin is the primary payment method, with the market having received $8.4 billion in transactions to date,"" the company said. ""Some transactions can be linked to funds stolen by North Korea.""
Xinbi, like HuiOne, has offered its services to scammers in Southeast Asia, including those responsible for so-called romance baiting schemes (formerly referred to as ""pig butchering""), which has become one of the most lucrative forms of cybercrime in recent years.
What's notable about these criminal bazaars is that they are entirely run on Telegram, becoming a one-stop shop to avail a wide range of services, ranging from technical tools to money laundering services to pull off online fraud at an industrial scale.
Xinbi Guarantee, per Elliptic, has 233,000 users, with merchants broken down to broad categories related to money laundering, Starlink satellite internet equipment, fake IDs, and databases of stolen personal information used to target potential victims.
Other vendors go a step further by offering to stalk and intimidate any chosen target within China, provide women to act as egg donors or surrogates, or even engage in sex trafficking, indicating that the illicit services go beyond cyber scams.

""The marketplace is seeing strong growth - with Q4 2024 the first quarter to see inflows of more than $1 billion,"" Elliptic said. ""Transaction volumes on Chinese-language Guarantee marketplaces such as Huione and Xinbi Guarantee dwarf those of the first generation of Tor-based darknet marketplaces.""
But perhaps the most interesting aspect of Xinbi is that it claims to be an ""investment and capital-guarantee group company"" registered in the U.S. state of Colorado by someone named Mohd Shahrulnizam Bin Abd Manap. According to the state corporate register, the company was incorporated in August 2022. It has since been marked as ""Delinquent"" for failing to file its periodic reports.

Both Xinbi and HuiOne Guarantee have also been used to launder cryptocurrency assets stolen by North Korea following the hack of the Indian cryptocurrency exchange WazirX last July, with $220,000 in USDT sent to the wallet addresses controlled by the former on November 12, 2024.
In response to the findings, Elliptic said Telegram has shut down thousands of channels belonging to the two services, effectively disrupting the two largest marketplaces that have engaged in over $35 billion in USDT transactions.
The development comes weeks after the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) designated Cambodia-based HuiOne Group as a ""primary money laundering concern"" in a bid to limit its access to the U.S. financial system.
""These platforms also provide a window onto a China-based underground banking system, based around stablecoins and other digital payments, which is being leveraged for money laundering on a significant scale,"" Elliptic said.
Update#
HuiOne/Haowang Guarantee, in a message posted on its website on May 13, said it's ceasing its operations since ""all our NFTs, channels and groups were blocked by Telegram."" The development was first reported by WIRED. 
""All business in the public group is provided by third-party merchants, which has nothing to do with Haowang's guarantee,"" the company claimed. ""We only provide guarantee services. We only conduct business on telegram, and telegram has long been blocked by mainland China. Mainland users cannot use telegram, so our default customers are non-mainland Chinese users.""

Elliptic, in a follow-up post, noted that guarantee marketplaces act as an intermediary between merchants and customers, with the administrator controlling access and operating anti-fraud mechanisms such as merchant deposits and escrow services.
The company further said that Telegram has been taking action against the HuiOne Guarantee and Xinbi Guarantee, deleting the entire channels and banning the associated usernames. This action, equivalent to a domain seizure, meant that the administrators could no longer use it to direct users to new channels, making it far more difficult to relaunch.
HuiOne Guarantee has since urged its merchants and other users to migrate to another marketplace named Tudou Guarantee, which has seen a 30% increase in user numbers. Tom Robinson, co-founder and chief scientist at Elliptic, told The Hacker News that ""there are already signs that Xinbi is trying to relaunch"" under the name Xinbi 2.0.
""The closure of Xinbi and Huione illustrate that centralised services such as Telegram are unlikely to ever be safe havens for criminal marketplaces in the long term, and this may spur the development of decentralized alternatives,"" Elliptic added. ""These would provide censorship-resistant communications methods, alongside the censorship-resistant payments made possible by cryptocurrencies.""
(The story was updated after publication to include additional insights from Elliptic.)"
2025-05-20 02:14:29,"May 14, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/ctm360-identifies-surge-in-phishing.html,CTM360 Identifies Surge in Phishing Attacks Targeting Meta Business Users,"A new global phishing threat called ""Meta Mirage"" has been uncovered, targeting businesses using Meta's Business Suite. This campaign specifically aims at hijacking high-value accounts, including those managing advertising and official brand pages.
Cybersecurity researchers at CTM360 revealed that attackers behind Meta Mirage impersonate official Meta communications, tricking users into handing over sensitive details like passwords and security codes (OTP).
The scale of this operation is alarming. Researchers have already identified over 14,000 malicious URLs, a concerning majority of which—nearly 78%—were not blocked by browsers at the time the report was published.
Cybercriminals cleverly hosted fake pages leveraging trusted cloud platforms like GitHub, Firebase, and Vercel, making it harder to spot the scams. This method aligns closely with recent findings from Microsoft, which highlighted similar abuse of cloud hosting services to compromise Kubernetes applications, emphasizing how attackers frequently leverage trusted platforms to evade detection.
The attackers deploy fake alerts about policy violations, account suspensions, or urgent verification notices. These messages, sent via email and direct messages, look convincing because they mimic official communications from Meta, often appearing urgent and authoritative. This tactic mirrors techniques observed in the recent Google Sites phishing campaign, which used authentic-looking Google-hosted pages to deceive users.
Two main methods are being used:

Credential Theft: Victims enter passwords and OTPs into realistic-looking fake websites. The attackers deliberately trigger fake error messages, causing users to re-enter their details, ensuring accurate and usable stolen information.
Cookie Theft: Scammers also steal browser cookies, allowing them continued access to compromised accounts even without passwords.

These compromised accounts don't just affect individual businesses—they're often exploited to run malicious advertising campaigns, further amplifying damage, similar to tactics observed in the PlayPraetor malware campaign that hijacked social media accounts for fraudulent ad distribution.

CTM360's report also outlines a structured and calculated approach used by the attackers to maximize effectiveness. Victims are initially contacted with mild, non-alarming notifications that progressively escalate in urgency and severity. Initial notices might mention generic policy violations, while subsequent messages warn of immediate suspensions or permanent deletion of accounts. This incremental escalation induces anxiety and urgency, driving users to act quickly without thoroughly verifying the authenticity of these messages.
To protect against this threat, CTM360 recommends:

Only use official devices to manage business social media accounts.
Use separate business-only email addresses.
Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
Regularly review account security settings and active sessions.
Train staff to recognize and report suspicious messages.

This widespread phishing campaign underscores the importance of vigilance and proactive security measures to protect valuable online assets."
2025-05-20 02:14:31,"May 14, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/earth-ammit-breached-drone-supply.html,"Earth Ammit Breached Drone Supply Chains via ERP in VENOM, TIDRONE Campaigns","A cyber espionage group known as Earth Ammit has been linked to two related but distinct campaigns from 2023 to 2024 targeting various entities in Taiwan and South Korea, including military, satellite, heavy industry, media, technology, software services, and healthcare sectors.
Cybersecurity firm Trend Micro said the first wave, codenamed VENOM, mainly targeted software service providers, while the second wave, referred to as TIDRONE, singled out the military industry. Earth Ammit is assessed to be connected to Chinese-speaking nation-state groups.
""In its VENOM campaign, Earth Ammit's approach involved penetrating the upstream segment of the drone supply chain,"" security researchers Pierre Lee, Vickie Su, and Philip Chen said. ""Earth Ammit's long-term goal is to compromise trusted networks via supply chain attacks, allowing them to target high-value entities downstream and amplify their reach.""
The TIDRONE campaign was first exposed by Trend Micro last year, detailing the cluster's attacks on drone manufacturers in Taiwan to deliver custom malware such as CXCLNT and CLNTEND. A subsequent report from AhnLab in December 2024 detailed the use of CLNTEND against South Korean companies.
The attacks are noteworthy for targeting the drone supply chain, leveraging enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to breach the military and satellite industries. Select incidents have also involved the use of trusted communication channels – such as remote monitoring or IT management tools – to distribute the malicious payloads.

The VENOM campaign, per Trend Micro, is characterized by the exploitation of web server vulnerabilities to drop web shells, and then weaponize the access to install remote access tools (RAT) for persistent access to the compromised hosts. The use of open-source tools like REVSOCK and Sliver in the attacks is seen as a deliberate attempt to cloud attribution efforts.
The only bespoke malware observed in the VENOM campaign is VENFRPC, a customized version of FRPC, which, in itself, is a modified version of the open-source fast reverse proxy (FRP) tool.

The end goal of the campaign is to harvest credentials from the breached environments and use the stolen information as a stepping stone to inform the next phase, TIDRONE, aimed at downstream customers. The TIDRONE campaign is spread over three stages - 

Initial access, which mirrors the VENOM campaign by targeting service providers to inject malicious code and distribute malware to downstream customers
Command-and-control, which makes use of a DLL loader to drop CXCLNT and CLNTEND backdoors
Post-exploitation, which involves setting up persistence, escalating privileges, disabling antivirus software using TrueSightKiller, and installing a screenshot-capturing tool dubbed SCREENCAP using CLNTEND

""CXCLNT's core functionality is dependent on a modular plugin system. Upon execution, it retrieves additional plugins from its C&C server to extend its capabilities dynamically,"" Trend Micro said. ""This architecture not only obscures the backdoor's true purpose during static analysis but also enables flexible, on-demand operations based on the attacker's objectives.""

CXCLNT is said to have been put to use in attacks since at least 2022. CLNTEND, first detected in 2024, is its successor and comes with an expanded set of features to sidestep detection.
The connection between VENOM and TIDRONE stems from shared victims and service providers and overlapping command-and-control infrastructure, indicating that a common threat actor is behind both campaigns. Trend Micro said the hacking crew's tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) resemble those used by another Chinese nation-state hacking group tracked as Dalbit (aka m00nlight), suggestive of a shared toolkit.

""This progression underscores a deliberate strategy: start broad with low-cost, low-risk tools to establish access, then pivot to tailored capabilities for more targeted and impactful intrusions,"" the researchers said. ""Understanding this operational pattern will be critical in predicting and defending against future threats from this actor.""
Japan and Taiwan Targeted by Swan Vector#
The disclosure comes as Seqrite Labs disclosed details of a cyber espionage campaign dubbed Swan Vector that has targeted educational institutes and the mechanical engineering industry in Taiwan and Japan with fake resume lures distributed via spear-phishing emails to deliver a DLL implant called Pterois, which is then used to download the Cobalt Strike shellcode.

Pterois is also engineered to download from Google Drive another malware referred to as Isurus that's then responsible for executing the Cobalt Strike post-exploitation framework. The campaign has been attributed to an East Asian threat actor with medium confidence.
""The threat actor is based out of East Asia and has been active since December 2024 targeting multiple hiring-based entities across Taiwan and Japan,"" security researcher Subhajeet Singha said.
""The threat actor relies on custom development of implants comprising of downloader, shellcode-loaders, and Cobalt Strike as their key tools with heavily relying on multiple evasion techniques like API hashing, direct-syscalls, function callback, DLL side-loading, and self-deletion to avoid leaving any sort of traces on the target machine."""
2025-05-20 02:14:32,"May 14, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/learning-how-to-hack-why-offensive.html,Learning How to Hack: Why Offensive Security Training Benefits Your Entire Security Team,"Organizations across industries are experiencing significant escalations in cyberattacks, particularly targeting critical infrastructure providers and cloud-based enterprises. Verizon's recently released 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report found an 18% YoY increase in confirmed breaches, with the exploitation of vulnerabilities as an initial access step growing by 34%. 
As attacks rise in volume and impact, many organizations turn to security tools and compliance standards as their first line of defense. While both are important and necessary components to mitigating cyber risk, they alone are not a silver bullet solution. Effective security requires people, process, and technology, but people must serve as the primary drivers. Your tools and checklists are only as strong as the practitioners implementing them at scale. 
This heightens the importance of investing in offensive operations training across every role in the security function. Too often, offensive operations are considered the singular domain of red teams and penetration testers. That narrow view limits its value. Ethical hacking, penetration testing, and other offensive skills provide critical insights that benefit numerous roles on a security team. It equips practitioners with a deeper understanding of how threat actors think and operate—foundational knowledge that directly strengthens an organization's collective security posture. 
CISOs that prioritize investments in this form of immersive, high-impact training can upskill their workforce and create more agile teams prepared to adapt in the face of evolving threats. For an inside look, here's how learning how to hack benefits four non-offensive security roles. 
New Practitioners: Grasping the Threat Landscape#
The cybersecurity workforce is evolving, unlike any industry. Efforts to offset global staffing shortages have ushered millions of new practitioners into the field in recent years. While this has helped to increase headcount, skill development is still lagging. Our SANS GIAC 2025 Cyber Workforce Research Report found that 52% of security leaders indicate their primary challenge is not the number of available professionals, but the lack of individuals with the right skills. 
New practitioners, especially those from conventional IT roles and non-security backgrounds, benefit immensely from exposure to offensive training. Reading about attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) in reports or courseware is valuable, but it doesn't compare to executing them in a scenario-based simulation. By actively replicating common attack paths like exploiting a misconfigured web server or bypassing access controls, practitioners begin to understand how threat actors capitalize on control gaps. This experience cultivates a more intuitive grasp of risk, teaching newcomers to approach security problems from a tactical perspective. 
Understanding attacker methodology also encourages better prioritization. It becomes easier to identify which vulnerabilities are most likely to be exploited and which alerts truly indicate malicious activity. Exposure to attacker tooling, from open-source frameworks to commercial payloads, gives practitioners a more grounded view of what the real-world threat landscape looks like. This knowledge accelerates their readiness to contribute meaningfully to detection engineering, triage, remediation, and various other efforts.
Incident Handlers: Staying Two Steps Ahead #
The integration of generative AI into TTPs has made the common threat actor increasingly capable of causing irremediable harm with a single breach. This means incident response demands speed, clarity, and precision now more than ever—the margin for error is razor thin. While tools and automation assist in detection, practitioners must be positioned to maximize operational efficiency in complex security environments. In turn, incident handlers who understand how adversaries operate are better equipped to move beyond simple playbooks and respond with intent. Offensive training sharpens this instinct. Practicing privilege escalation, persistence techniques, or lateral movement in simulated environments equips handlers to recognize attacker objectives and anticipate next steps, even before alerts are triggered.
Attackers often follow repeatable workflows. Once you've performed these techniques yourself—such as abusing misconfigured Active Directory permissions or exploiting token impersonation—you become more attuned to subtle indicators of compromise that detection tools may overlook. Moreover, a deeper knowledge of adversary behavior supports faster root cause analysis and containment. Knowing the constraints and habits of threat actors allows response teams to hunt proactively, isolate affected systems more accurately, and recommend remediations that address root weaknesses.
Forensic Analysts: Contextualizing Digital Artifacts#
Digital forensics depends on the ability to reconstruct events using logs, memory dumps, file systems, and other artifacts. While forensic tools provide visibility, their outputs often lack clear meaning without practical context. Analysts who have studied and executed offensive techniques are more likely to recognize the operational patterns behind technical data. That insight could mean the difference between a basic report and one that truly reflects attacker activity.
When an analyst have created malicious payloads or evaded logging mechanisms in a training environment, they can better decipher the nuances of what a tool is flagging. This aids in recognizing forged timestamps, tampered registry keys, or anomalous process execution sequences. Analysts are then able to formulate stronger hypotheses and trace lateral movement with greater precision. 
Security Managers: Validating Strategy with Adversary Insight#
Security managers are often tasked with aligning cyber defenses to organizational priorities and evolving business risks. While they may not be writing detection rules or responding to incidents directly, their decisions have a lasting impact on risk posture and program maturity. Managers who have participated in the right ethical hacking programs gain strategic clarity that is difficult to acquire otherwise. They know what high-quality penetration testing looks like, how real adversaries exploit systemic weaknesses, and where their teams may have blind spots.
That perspective helps managers avoid overreliance on toolsets or compliance frameworks that provide a false sense of assurance. When you understand how adversaries chain together low-severity vulnerabilities, bypass weak configurations, or exploit human behavior, you are better positioned to ask the right questions of vendors and internal teams. It also allows you to define more meaningful red team objectives, assess ROI from testing efforts, and ensure remediation efforts focus on exploitable gaps, not just policy violations.

2025-05-20 02:14:36,"May 14, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/horabot-malware-targets-6-latin.html,Horabot Malware Targets 6 Latin American Nations Using Invoice-Themed Phishing Emails,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a new phishing campaign that's being used to distribute malware called Horabot targeting Windows users in Latin American countries like Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Peru, Chile, and Argentina.
The campaign is ""using crafted emails that impersonate invoices or financial documents to trick victims into opening malicious attachments and can steal email credentials, harvest contact lists, and install banking trojans,"" Fortinet FortiGuard Labs researcher Cara Lin said.
The activity, observed by the network security company in April 2025, has primarily singled out Spanish-speaking users. The attacks have also been found to send phishing messages from victims' mailboxes using Outlook COM automation, effectively propagating the malware laterally within corporate or personal networks.

In addition, the threat actors behind the campaign execute various VBScript, AutoIt, and PowerShell scripts to conduct system reconnaissance, steal credentials, and drop additional payloads.
Horabot was first documented by Cisco Talos in June 2023 as targeting Spanish-speaking users in Latin America since at least November 2020. It's assessed that the attacks are the work of a threat actor from Brazil.
Then last year, Trustwave SpiderLabs revealed details of another phishing campaign targeting the same region with malicious payloads which it said exhibits similarities with that of Horabot malware.

The latest set of attacks starts with a phishing email that employs invoice-themed lures to entice users into opening a ZIP archive containing a PDF document. However, in reality, the attached ZIP file contains a malicious HTML file with Base64-encoded HTML data that's designed to reach out to a remote server and download the next-stage payload.
The payload is another ZIP archive that contains an HTML Application (HTA) file, which is responsible for loading a script hosted on a remote server. The script then injects an external Visual Basic Script (VBScript) that performs a series of checks that cause it to terminate if Avast antivirus is installed or it's running in a virtual environment.

The VBScript proceeds to collect basic system information, exfiltrate it to a remote server, and retrieves additional payloads, including an AutoIt script that unleashes the banking trojan by means of a malicious DLL and a PowerShell script that's tasked with spreading the phishing emails after building a list of target email addresses by scanning contact data within Outlook.
""The malware then proceeds to steal browser-related data from a range of targeted web browsers, including Brave, Yandex, Epic Privacy Browser, Comodo Dragon, Cent Browser, Opera, Microsoft Edge, and Google Chrome,"" Lin said. ""In addition to data theft, Horabot monitors the victim's behavior and injects fake pop-up windows designed to capture sensitive user login credentials."""

Of the 78 flaws resolved by the tech giant, 11 are rated Critical, 66 are rated Important, and one is rated Low in severity. Twenty-eight of these vulnerabilities lead to remote code execution, 21 of them are privilege escalation bugs, and 16 others are classified as information disclosure flaws.
The updates are in addition to eight more security defects patched by the company in its Chromium-based Edge browser since the release of last month's Patch Tuesday update.
The five vulnerabilities that have come under active exploitation in the wild are listed below -

CVE-2025-30397 (CVSS score: 7.5) - Scripting Engine Memory Corruption Vulnerability
CVE-2025-30400 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Microsoft Desktop Window Manager (DWM) Core Library Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
CVE-2025-32701 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability
CVE-2025-32706 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability 
CVE-2025-32709 (CVSS score: 7.8) - Windows Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability

While the first three flaws have been credited to Microsoft's own threat intelligence team, Benoit Sevens of Google Threat Intelligence Group and the CrowdStrike Advanced Research Team have been acknowledged for the discovery of CVE-2025-32706. An anonymous researcher has been credited with reporting CVE-2025-32709.

""Another zero-day vulnerability has been identified in the Microsoft Scripting Engine, a key component used by Internet Explorer and Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge,"" Alex Vovk, CEO and co-founder of Action1, said about CVE-2025-30397.
""Attackers can exploit the flaw via a malicious web page or script that causes the scripting engine to misinterpret object types, resulting in memory corruption and arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. If the user has administrative privileges, attackers could gain full system control – enabling data theft, malware installation, and lateral movement across networks.""
CVE-2025-30400 is the third privilege escalation flaw in DWM Core Library to be weaponized in the wild since 2023. In May 2024, Microsoft issued patches for CVE-2024-30051, which Kaspersky said was used in attacks distributing QakBot (aka Qwaking Mantis) malware.
""Since 2022, Patch Tuesday has addressed 26 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in DWM,"" Satnam Narang, senior staff research engineer at Tenable, said in a statement shared with The Hacker News.
""In fact, the April 2025 release included fixes for five DWM Core Library elevation of privilege vulnerabilities. Prior to CVE-2025-30400, only two DWM elevation of privilege bugs were exploited as zero days – CVE-2024-30051 in 2024 and CVE-2023-36033 in 2023.""
CVE-2025-32701 and CVE-2025-32706 are the seventh and eighth privilege escalation flaws to be discovered in the CLFS component and have been exploited in real-world attacks since 2022. Last month, Microsoft revealed that CVE-2025-29824 was exploited in limited attacks to target companies in the U.S., Venezuela, Spain, and Saudi Arabia.
CVE-2025-29824 is also said to have been exploited as a zero-day by threat actors linked to the Play ransomware family as part of an attack targeting an unnamed organization in the U.S., Broadcom-owned Symantec revealed earlier this month.
CVE-2025-32709, likewise, is the third privilege escalation flaw in the Ancillary Function Driver for WinSock component to have come under abuse within a span of a year, after CVE-2024-38193 and CVE-2025-21418. It's worth noting that the exploitation of CVE-2024-38193 has been attributed to the North Korea-linked Lazarus Group.
The development has prompted the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to add all five vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, requiring federal agencies to apply the fixes by June 3, 2025.
Microsoft's Patch Tuesday update also addresses a privilege escalation bug in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint for Linux (CVE-2025-26684, CVSS score: 6.7) that could permit an authorized attacker to elevate privileges locally.
Stratascale researcher Rich Mirch, who is one of the two researchers, acknowledged for reporting the vulnerability, said the issue is rooted in a Python helper script that includes a function (""grab_java_version()"") to determine the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version.
""The function determines the location of the Java binary on disk by checking the /proc/<PID>/exe symbolic link and then executes the java -version command,"" Mirch explained. ""The problem is the Java binary could be running from an untrusted location. A malicious local unprivileged user can create a process with the name java or javaw, which will eventually be executed with root privileges to determine the version of the JRE.""

Another notable flaw is a spoofing vulnerability affecting Microsoft Defender for Identity (CVE-2025-26685, CVSS score: 6.5) that allows an attacker with LAN access to perform spoofing over an adjacent network.
""The lateral movement path detection feature can itself potentially be exploited by an adversary to obtain an NTLM hash,"" Adam Barnett, lead software engineer at Rapid7, said in a statement. ""The compromised credentials in this case would be those of the Directory Services account, and exploitation relies on achieving fallback from Kerberos to NTLM.""
The vulnerability with the maximum-severity is CVE-2025-29813 (CVSS score: 10.0), a privilege escalation flaw in Azure DevOps Server that allows an unauthorized attacker to elevate privileges over a network. Microsoft said the shortcoming has been already deployed in the cloud and there is no action required on the part of customers.

The vulnerabilities in question are listed below -

CVE-2025-4427 (CVSS score: 5.3) - An authentication bypass in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing attackers to access protected resources without proper credentials
CVE-2025-4428 (CVSS score: 7.2) - A remote code execution vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target system

An attacker that successfully exploits these flaws could chain them together to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable device without authentication.

The flaws impact the following versions of the product -

11.12.0.4 and prior (Fixed in 11.12.0.5)
12.3.0.1 and prior (Fixed in 12.3.0.2) 
12.4.0.1 and prior (Fixed in 12.4.0.2)
12.5.0.0 and prior (Fixed in 12.5.0.1)

Ivanti, which credited CERT-EU for reporting the issues, said it's ""aware of a very limited number of customers who have been exploited at the time of disclosure"" and that the vulnerabilities are ""associated with two open-source libraries integrated into EPMM.""
The company, however, did not disclose the names of the impacted libraries. It's also not known what other software applications relying on the two libraries could be affected. Furthermore, the company said it's still investigating the cases, and that it does not have reliable indicators of compromise associated with the malicious activity.
""The risk to customers is significantly reduced if they already filter access to the API using either the built-in Portal ACLs functionality or an external web application firewall,"" Ivanti noted.
""The issue only affects the on-prem EPMM product. It is not present in Ivanti Neurons for MDM, Ivanti's cloud-based unified endpoint management solution, Ivanti Sentry, or any other Ivanti products.""

Separately, Ivanti has also shipped patches to contain an authentication bypass flaw in on-premise versions of Neurons for ITSM (CVE-2025-22462, CVSS score: 9.8) that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain administrative access to the system. There is no evidence that the security defect has been exploited in the wild.
With zero-days in Ivanti appliances becoming a lightning rod for threat actors in recent years, it's imperative that users move quickly to update their instances to the latest versions for optimal protection.
Update#
watchTowr Labs has released a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the Ivanti EPMM exploit chain that combines CVE-2025-4427 and CVE-2025-4428 to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.
The cybersecurity company noted that, while a third-party called ""hibernate-validator"" has been updated from version 6.0.22 to 6.2.5, it found that it was able to successfully execute arbitrary commands by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to ""/mifs/admin/rest/api/v2/featureusage.""
It also pointed out CVE-2025-4427 isn't actually an authentication bypass, but more of an order of operations vulnerability, which occurs when logic flaws exist within the order in which security boundaries are applied in code. ""Is this really a vulnerability in a third-party library, or incorrect and dangerous usage of known-scary functions?,"" security researcher Piotr Bazydlo posed."

""Actors leveraged CVE-2025-31324, an unauthenticated file upload vulnerability that enables remote code execution (RCE),"" EclecticIQ researcher Arda Büyükkaya said in an analysis published today.
Targets of the campaign include natural gas distribution networks, water and integrated waste management utilities in the United Kingdom, medical device manufacturing plants oil and gas exploration and production companies in the United States, and government ministries in Saudi Arabia that are responsible for investment strategy and financial regulation.
The findings are based on a publicly exposed directory uncovered on attacker-controlled infrastructure (""15.204.56[.]106"") that contained event logs capturing the activities across multiple compromised systems.
The Dutch cybersecurity company has attributed the intrusions to Chinese threat activity clusters tracked as UNC5221, UNC5174, and CL-STA-0048, the last of which was linked to attacks targeting high-value targets in South Asia by exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing IIS, Apache Tomcat, and MS-SQL servers to drop web shells, reverse shells, and the PlugX backdoor.

It also noted that an uncategorized China-nexus threat actor is conducting a widespread internet scanning and exploitation campaign against SAP NetWeaver systems. The server hosted at the IP address ""15.204.56[.]106"" has been found to contain multiple files, including -

""CVE-2025-31324-results.txt,"" which has recorded 581 SAP NetWeaver instances compromised and backdoored with a web shell
""服务数据_20250427_212229.txt,"" which lists 800 domains running SAP NetWeaver likely for future targeting

""The exposed open-dir infrastructure reveals confirmed breaches and highlights the group's planned targets, offering clear insight into both past and future operations,"" Büyükkaya noted.
The exploitation of CVE-2025-31324 is followed by the threat actor deploying two web shells that are designed to maintain persistent remote access to the infected systems and execute arbitrary commands.
In addition, three different Chinese hacking groups have been observed exploiting the SAP NetWeaver vulnerability as part of efforts to maintain remote access, conduct reconnaissance, and drop malicious programs -

CL-STA-0048, which has attempted to establish an interactive reverse shell to ""43.247.135[.]53,"" an IP address previously identified as used by the threat actor
UNC5221, which has leveraged a web shell to deploy KrustyLoader, a Rust-based malware that can used to serve second-stage payloads like Sliver, set up persistence, and execute shell commands
UNC5174, which has leveraged a web shell to download SNOWLIGHT, a loader that initiates a connection with a hard-coded server to fetch a Go-based remote access trojan named VShell and a backdoor known as GOREVERSE

""China-linked APTs are highly likely to continue targeting internet-exposed enterprise applications and edge devices to establish long-term strategic and persistence access to critical infrastructure networks globally,"" Büyükkaya said.

""Their focus on widely used platforms like SAP NetWeaver is a strategic move, as these systems are deeply integrated into enterprise environments and often host unpatched vulnerabilities.""
SAP Patches New Actively Exploited NetWeaver Flaw#
The disclosure comes days after another China-linked unnamed threat actor dubbed Chaya_004 has also been attributed to the exploitation of CVE-2025-31324 to deploy a Go-based reverse shell called SuperShell.

SAP security firm Onapsis said it is ""seeing significant activity from attackers who are using public information to trigger exploitation and abuse web shells placed by the original attackers, who have currently gone dark.""
Further analysis of these attacks has led to the discovery of another critical defect in NetWeaver's Visual Composer Metadata Uploader component. Tracked as CVE-2025-42999 (CVSS score: 9.1), it has been described as a deserialization vulnerability that could be exploited by a privileged user to upload untrusted or malicious content.
""The attacks we observed during March 2025 (that started with basic probes back in January 2025) are actually abusing both, the lack of authentication (CVE-2025-31324) as well as the insecure de-serialization (CVE-2025-42999),"" Onapsis CTO, Juan Pablo (JP) Perez-Etchegoyen, told The Hacker News.
""This combination allowed attackers to execute arbitrary commands remotely and without any type of privileges on the system. Organizations that effectively and timely applied SAP Security Note 3594142 (Patch for CVE-2025-31324), mitigated significantly the risk of exploitation.""
""Organizations should now apply SAP Security Note 3604119 to remove any residual risk on the SAP Applications. This residual risk is basically a de-serialization vulnerability only exploitable by users with VisualComposerUser role on the SAP target system.""
In light of ongoing active exploitation, customers of SAP NetWeaver are recommended to update their instances to the latest version as soon as possible.
(The story was updated after publication on May 14, 2025, to confirm active exploitation of CVE-2025-42999.)"
2025-05-20 02:14:44,"May 13, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/malicious-pypi-package-posing-as-solana.html,Malicious PyPI Package Posing as Solana Tool Stole Source Code in 761 Downloads,"Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malicious package on the Python Package Index (PyPI) repository that purports to be an application related to the Solana blockchain, but contains malicious functionality to steal source code and developer secrets.
The package, named solana-token, is no longer available for download from PyPI, but not before it was downloaded 761 times. It was first published to PyPI in early April 2024, albeit with an entirely different version numbering scheme.
""When installed, the malicious package attempts to exfiltrate source code and developer secrets from the developer's machine to a hard-coded IP address,"" ReversingLabs researcher Karlo Zanki said in a report shared with The Hacker News.

In particular, the package is designed to copy and exfiltrate the source code contained in all the files in the Python execution stack under the guise of a blockchain function named ""register_node().""
This unusual behavior suggests that the attackers are looking to exfiltrate sensitive crypto-related secrets that may be hard-coded in the early stages of writing a program incorporating the malicious function in question.
It's believed that developers looking to create their own blockchains were the likely targets of the threat actors behind the package. This assessment is based on the package name and the functions built into it.

The exact method by which the package may have been distributed to users is currently not known, although it's likely to have been promoted on developer-focused platforms.
If anything, the discovery underscores the fact that cryptocurrency continues to be one of the most popular targets for supply chain threat actors, necessitating that developers take steps to scrutinize every package before using it. 
""Development teams need to aggressively monitor for suspicious activity or unexplained changes within both open source and commercial, third-party software modules,"" Zanki said. ""By stopping malicious code before it is allowed to penetrate secure development environments, teams can prevent the kind of destructive supply chain attacks."""
2025-05-20 02:14:46,"May 13, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/deepfake-defense-in-age-of-ai.html,Deepfake Defense in the Age of AI,"The cybersecurity landscape has been dramatically reshaped by the advent of generative AI. Attackers now leverage large language models (LLMs) to impersonate trusted individuals and automate these social engineering tactics at scale. 
Let's review the status of these rising attacks, what's fueling them, and how to actually prevent, not detect, them. 
The Most Powerful Person on the Call Might Not Be Real#
Recent threat intelligence reports highlight the growing sophistication and prevalence of AI-driven attacks:

Voice Phishing Surge: According to CrowdStrike's 2025 Global Threat Report, there was a 442% increase in voice phishing (vishing) attacks between the first and second halves of 2024, driven by AI-generated phishing and impersonation tactics.
Social Engineering Prevalence: Verizon's 2025 Data Breach Investigations Report indicates that social engineering remains a top pattern in breaches, with phishing and pretexting accounting for a significant portion of incidents
North Korean Deepfake Operations: North Korean threat actors have been observed using deepfake technology to create synthetic identities for online job interviews, aiming to secure remote work positions and infiltrate organizations.

In this new era, trust can't be assumed or merely detected. It must be proven deterministically and in real-time.
Why the Problem Is Growing#
Three trends are converging to make AI impersonation the next big threat vector:

AI makes deception cheap and scalable: With open-source voice and video tools, threat actors can impersonate anyone with just a few minutes of reference material.
Virtual collaboration exposes trust gaps: Tools like Zoom, Teams, and Slack assume the person behind a screen is who they claim to be. Attackers exploit that assumption.
Defenses generally rely on probability, not proof: Deepfake detection tools use facial markers and analytics to guess if someone is real. That's not good enough in a high-stakes environment.

And while endpoint tools or user training may help, they're not built to answer a critical question in real-time: Can I trust this person I am talking to?
AI Detection Technologies Are Not Enough#
Traditional defenses focus on detection, such as training users to spot suspicious behavior or using AI to analyze whether someone is fake. But deepfakes are getting too good, too fast. You can't fight AI-generated deception with probability-based tools.
Actual prevention requires a different foundation, one based on provable trust, not assumption. That means:

Identity Verification: Only verified, authorized users should be able to join sensitive meetings or chats based on cryptographic credentials, not passwords or codes.
Device Integrity Checks: If a user's device is infected, jailbroken, or non-compliant, it becomes a potential entry point for attackers, even if their identity is verified. Block these devices from meetings until they're remediated. 
Visible Trust Indicators: Other participants need to see proof that each person in the meeting is who they say they are and is on a secure device. This removes the burden of judgment from end users.

Prevention means creating conditions where impersonation isn't just hard, it's impossible. That's how you shut down AI deepfake attacks before they join high-risk conversations like board meetings, financial transactions, or vendor collaborations. 



Detection-Based Approach
Prevention Approach




Flag anomalies after they occur
Block unauthorized users from ever joining


Rely on heuristics & guesswork
Use cryptographic proof of identity


Require user judgment
Provide visible, verified trust indicators

2025-05-20 02:14:47,"May 13, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/north-korean-konni-apt-targets-ukraine.html,North Korean Konni APT Targets Ukraine with Malware to track Russian Invasion Progress,"The North Korea-linked threat actor known as Konni APT has been attributed to a phishing campaign targeting government entities in Ukraine, indicating the threat actor's targeting beyond Russia.
Enterprise security firm Proofpoint said the end goal of the campaign is to collect intelligence on the ""trajectory of the Russian invasion.""
""The group's interest in Ukraine follows historical targeting of government entities in Russia for strategic intelligence gathering purposes,"" security researchers Greg Lesnewich, Saher Naumaan, and Mark Kelly said in a report shared with The Hacker News.
Konni APT, also known as Opal Sleet, Osmium, TA406, and Vedalia, is a cyber espionage group that has a history of targeting entities in South Korea, the United States, and Russia. It's operational since at least 2014.
Attack chains mounted by the threat actor often involve the use of phishing emails to distribute malware called Konni RAT (aka UpDog) and redirect recipients to credential harvesting pages. Proofpoint, in an analysis of the threat group published in November 2021, assessed TA406 to be one of several actors that make up the activity publicly tracked as Kimsuky, Thallium, and Konni Group.
The latest set of attacks documented by the cybersecurity company entails the use of phishing emails that impersonate a fictitious senior fellow at a think tank called the Royal Institute of Strategic Studies, which is also a non-existent organization.
The email messages contain a link to a password-protected RAR archive that's hosted on the MEGA cloud service. Opening the RAR archive using a password mentioned in the message body launches an infection sequence that's engineered to conduct extensive reconnaissance of the compromised machines.

Specifically, present within the RAR archive is a CHM file that displays decoy content related to former Ukrainian military leader Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. Should the victim click anywhere on the page, a PowerShell command embedded within the HTML is executed to reach out to an external server and download a next-stage PowerShell payload.
The newly launched PowerShell script is capable of executing various commands to gather information about the system, encode it using Base64-encoding, and send it to the same server.
""The actor sent multiple phishing emails on consecutive days when the target did not click the link, asking the target if they had received the prior emails and if they would download the files,"" the researchers said.
Proofpoint said it also observed an HTML file being directly distributed as an attachment to the phishing messages. In this variation of the attack, the victim is instructed to click on an embedded link in the HTML file, resulting in the download of a ZIP archive that includes a benign PDF and a Windows shortcut (LNK) file.
When the LNK is run, it executes Base64-encoded PowerShell to drop a Javascript Encoded file called ""Themes.jse"" using a Visual Basic Script. The JSE malware, in turn, contacts an attacker-controlled URL and runs the response from the server via PowerShell. The exact nature of the payload is currently not known.
Furthermore, TA406 has been spotted attempting to harvest credentials by sending fake Microsoft security alert messages to Ukrainian government entities from ProtonMail accounts, warning them of suspicious sign-in activity from IP addresses located in the United States and urging them to verify the login by visiting a link.
While the credential harvesting page has not been recovered, the same compromised domain is said to have been used in the past to collect Naver login information.
""These credential harvesting campaigns took place prior to the attempted malware deployments and targeted some of the same users later targeted with the HTML delivery campaign,"" Proofpoint said. ""TA406 is very likely gathering intelligence to help North Korean leadership determine the current risk to its forces already in the theatre, as well as the likelihood that Russia will request more troops or armaments.""
""Unlike Russian groups who have likely been tasked with gathering tactical battlefield information and targeting of Ukrainian forces in situ, TA406 has typically focused on more strategic, political intelligence collection efforts.""
Kimsuky Attack Chain Targeting South Korea
The disclosure comes as the Konni group has been linked to a sophisticated multi-stage malware campaign targeting entities in South Korea with ZIP archives containing LNK files, which run PowerShell scripts to extract a CAB archive and ultimately deliver batch script malware capable of collecting sensitive data and exfiltrating it to a remote server.
The findings also dovetail with spear-phishing campaigns orchestrated by Kimsuky to target government agencies in South Korea by delivering a stealer malware capable of establishing command-and-control (C2 or C&C) communications and exfiltrating files, web browser data, and cryptocurrency wallet information.
Kimsuky Attack Chain Delivering PEBBLEDASH
According to South Korean cybersecurity company AhnLab, Kimsuky has also been observed propagating PEBBLEDASH as part of a multi-stage infection sequence initiated via spear-phishing. The trojan was attributed by the U.S. government to the Lazarus Group in May 2020.
""While the Kimsuky group uses various types of malware, in the case of PEBBLEDASH, they execute malware based on an LNK file by spear-phishing in the initial access stage to launch their attacks,"" it said.

""They then utilize a PowerShell script to create a task scheduler and register it for automatic execution. Through communication with a Dropbox and TCP socket-based C&C server, the group installs multiple malware and tools including PEBBLEDASH.""
Konni and Kimsuky are far from the only North Korean threat actors to focus on Seoul. As recently as March 2025, South Korean entities have been found to be at the receiving end of another campaign carried out by APT37, which is also referred to as ScarCruft.
Dubbed Operation ToyBox Story, the spear-phishing attacks singled out several activists focused on North Korea, per the Genians Security Center (GSC). The first observed spear phishing attack occurred on March 8, 2025.
""The email contained a Dropbox link leading to a compressed archive that included a malicious shortcut (LNK) file,"" the South Korean company said. ""When extracted and executed, the LNK file activated additional malware containing the keyword 'toy.'""
APT37 Operation ToyBox Story Attack Chain
The LNK files are configured to launch a decoy HWP file and run PowerShell commands, leading to the execution of files named toy03.bat, toy02.bat, and toy01.bat (in that order), the last of which contains shellcode to launch RoKRAT, a staple malware associated with APT37.
RokRAT is equipped to collect system information, capture screenshots, and use three different cloud services, including pCloud, Yandex, and Dropbox for C2.
""The threat actors exploited legitimate cloud services as C2 infrastructure and continued to modify shortcut (LNK) files while focusing on fileless attack techniques to evade detection by antivirus software installed on target endpoints,"" Genians said."

""He is wanted internationally for committing several cybercrimes (ransomware attacks, blackmail, and money laundering) against companies based in the Netherlands,"" officials said in a statement Monday.
In conjunction with the arrest, police seized over €84,000 ($93,000) in cash, an electronic wallet, two laptops, a mobile phone, a tablet, six bank cards, two data storage devices, and six memory cards.
The suspect's name was not disclosed. But he is said to have been detained after a search of his residence in Moldova. In at least one instance, the individual conducted a ransomware attack on the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO), causing material damage worth approximately €4.5 million.
The attack took place in February 2021, resulting in the leak of internal documents after the organization refused to pay up. It was attributed to a ransomware crew known as DoppelPaymer.

""The attacker blocked network drives, rendered documents inaccessible, and stole some of our files,"" NWO disclosed at the time. ""Following a demand for a ransom, which NWO cannot and will not accept on principle, the organization published some of the stolen files.""

DoppelPaymer, a ransomware family that first appeared in June 2019, is believed to be based on the BitPaymer ransomware, due to similarities in their source code, ransom notes, and payment portals.
In March 2023, law enforcement authorities from Germany and Ukraine targeted suspected core members of a cybercrime group that has been behind large-scale attacks using DoppelPaymer ransomware.
Germany also issued arrest warrants against three alleged DoppelPaymer operatives – lgor Olegovich Turashev, Igor Garshin (aka Igor Garschin), and Irina Zemlianikina – who are said to be the ""masterminds of the criminal group."""
2025-05-20 02:14:54,"May 13, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/turkiye-hackers-exploited-output.html,Türkiye Hackers Exploited Output Messenger Zero-Day to Drop Golang Backdoors on Kurdish Servers,"A Türkiye-affiliated threat actor exploited a zero-day security flaw in an Indian enterprise communication platform called Output Messenger as part of a cyber espionage attack campaign since April 2024.
""These exploits have resulted in a collection of related user data from targets in Iraq,"" the Microsoft Threat Intelligence team said. ""The targets of the attack are associated with the Kurdish military operating in Iraq, consistent with previously observed Marbled Dust targeting priorities.""
The activity has been attributed to a threat group it tracks as Marbled Dust (formerly Silicon), which is also known as Cosmic Wolf, Sea Turtle, Teal Kurma, and UNC1326. The hacking crew is believed to have been active since at least 2017, although it wasn't until two years later that Cisco Talos documented attacks targeting public and private entities in the Middle East and North Africa.
Early last year, it was also identified as targeting telecommunication, media, internet service providers (ISPs), information technology (IT)-service providers, and Kurdish websites in the Netherlands.

Microsoft has assessed with moderate confidence that the threat actor has conducted some sort of reconnaissance beforehand to determine if its targets are Output Messenger users and then leverage the zero-day to distribute malicious payloads and exfiltrate data from targets.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2025-27920, a directory traversal vulnerability affecting version 2.0.62 that allows remote attackers to access or execute arbitrary files. The issue has been addressed by its developer Srimax as of late December 2024 with version 2.0.63. The company, however, makes no mention of the flaw being exploited in the wild in its advisory.
The attack chain starts with the threat actor gaining access to the Output Messenger Server Manager application as an authenticated user. It's believed that Marbled Dust uses techniques like DNS hijacking or typosquatted domains to intercept the credentials required for authentication.
The access is then abused to collect the user's Output Messenger credentials and exploit CVE-2025-27920 to drop payloads like ""OM.vbs"" and ""OMServerService.vbs"" to the server startup folder and ""OMServerService.exe"" to the server's ""Users/public/videos"" directory.
In the next phase, the threat actor uses ""OMServerService.vbs"" to invoke ""OM.vbs"" and ""OMServerService.exe,"" the latter of which is a Golang backdoor that contacts a hard-coded domain (""api.wordinfos[.]com"") for data exfiltration.
""On the client side, the installer extracts and executes both the legitimate file OutputMessenger.exe and OMClientService.exe, another Golang backdoor that connects to a Marbled Dust command-and-control (C2) domain,"" Microsoft noted.
""This backdoor first performs a connectivity check via a GET request to the C2 domain api.wordinfos[.]com. If successful, a second GET request is sent to the same C2 containing hostname information to uniquely identify the victim. The response from the C2 is then directly executed using the command 'cmd /c' which instructs the Windows command prompt to run a specific command and then terminate.""

At one case involved a victim device with Output Messenger client software installed connecting to an IP address previously identified as used by Marbled Dust for likely data exfiltration.
The tech giant also noted that it discovered a second flaw, reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the same version (CVE-2025-27921), although it said it found no evidence of it being weaponized in real-world attacks.
""This new attack signals a notable shift in Marbled Dust's capability while maintaining consistency in their overall approach,"" Microsoft said. ""The successful use of a zero-day exploit suggests an increase in technical sophistication and could also suggest that Marbled Dust's targeting priorities have escalated or that their operational goals have become more urgent."""

DriverHub is a tool that's designed to automatically detect the motherboard model of a computer and display necessary driver updates for subsequent installation by communicating with a dedicated site hosted at ""driverhub.asus[.]com.""
The flaws identified in the software are listed below -

CVE-2025-3462 (CVSS score: 8.4) - An origin validation error vulnerability that may allow unauthorized sources to interact with the software's features via crafted HTTP requests
CVE-2025-3463 (CVSS score: 9.4) - An improper certificate validation vulnerability that may allow untrusted sources to affect system behavior via crafted HTTP requests

Security researcher MrBruh, who is credited with discovering and reporting the two vulnerabilities, said they could be exploited to achieve remote code execution as part of a one-click attack.

The attack chain essentially involves tricking an unsuspecting user into visiting a sub-domain of driverhub.asus[.]com (e.g., driverhub.asus.com.<random string>.com) and then leveraging the DriverHub's UpdateApp endpoint to execute a legitimate version of the ""AsusSetup.exe"" binary with an option set to run any file hosted on the fake domain.
""When executing AsusSetup.exe it first reads from AsusSetup.ini, which contains metadata about the driver,"" the researcher explained in a technical report.
""If you run AsusSetup.exe with the -s flag (DriverHub calls it using this to do a silent install), it will execute whatever is specified in SilentInstallRun. In this case, the ini file specifies a cmd script that performs an automated headless install of the driver, but it could run anything.""
All an attacker needs to successfully pull off the exploit is to create a domain, and host three files, the malicious payload to be run, an altered version of AsusSetup.ini that has the ""SilentInstallRun"" property set to the malicious binary, and AsusSetup.exe, which then make use of the property to run the payload.
Following responsible disclosure on April 8, 2025, the issues were fixed by ASUS on May 9. There is no evidence that the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild.
""This update includes important security updates and ASUS strongly recommends that users update their ASUS DriverHub installation to the latest version,"" the company said in a bulletin. ""The latest Software Update can be accessed by opening ASUS DriverHub, then clicking the 'Update Now' button."""

⚡ Threat of the Week#
5Socks Proxy Using IoT, EoL Systems Dismantled in Law Enforcement Operation — A joint law enforcement operation undertaken by Dutch and U.S. authorities dismantled a criminal proxy network, known as anyproxy[.]net and 5socks[.]net, that was powered by thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) and end-of-life (EoL) devices, enlisting them into a botnet for providing anonymity to malicious actors. The illicit platform, active since 2004, advertised more than 7,000 online proxies daily, with infected devices mainly located in the U.S., Canada and Ecuador. The attacks targeted IoT devices susceptible to known security flaws to deploy a malware called TheMoon. The development comes as two other law enforcement operations have felled the eXch cryptocurrency exchange for facilitating money laundering and six DDoS-for-hire services that were used to launch thousands of cyber-attacks across the world.

COLDRIVER Uses ClickFix to Distribute LOSTKEYS Malware — The Russia-linked threat actor known as COLDRIVER has been observed distributing a new malware called LOSTKEYS as part of an espionage-focused campaign using ClickFix-like social engineering lures. The attacks, detected in January, March, and April 2025, targeted current and former advisors to Western governments and militaries, as well as journalists, think tanks, and NGOs, as well as individuals connected to Ukraine. LOSTKEYS is designed to steal files from a hard-coded list of extensions and directories, along with sending system information and running processes to the attacker.
Play Ransomware Attack Exploited CVE-2025-29824 as a 0-Day — Threat actors with links to the Play ransomware family exploited a recently patched security flaw in Microsoft Windows as a zero-day as part of an attack targeting an unnamed organization in the United States. The attack leveraged CVE-2025-29824, a privilege escalation flaw in the Common Log File System (CLFS) driver that was patched by Microsoft last month. That said, no ransomware was actually deployed in the attack. However, Grixba, a custom information stealer known to be used by the Play ransomware operation, was put to use.
NSO Group Ordered to Pay $168 Million in Damages to WhatsApp — Israeli company NSO Group was ordered by a federal jury in the U.S. to pay Meta-owned WhatsApp WhatsApp approximately $168 million in monetary damages, more than four months after a federal judge ruled that the Israeli company violated U.S. laws by exploiting WhatsApp servers to deploy Pegasus spyware targeting more than 1,400 individuals globally. In addition, the jury determined that NSO Group must pay WhatsApp $444,719 in compensatory damages for the significant efforts WhatsApp engineers made to block the attack vectors. WhatsApp originally filed the lawsuit against NSO Group in 2019, accusing NSO Group of exploiting WhatsApp using a then-zero-day vulnerability in the messaging app to target journalists, human rights activists, and political dissidents. NSO Group said it will appeal the ruling.
3 Malicious npm Packages Target Cursor Users — Three malicious npm packages named sw-cur, sw-cur1, and aiide-cur have been flagged in the npm registry as designed to target the Apple macOS version of Cursor, a popular artificial intelligence (AI)-powered source code editor. The packages claim to be offering ""the cheapest Cursor API,"" but contain functionality to modify legitimate files associated with the software to execute arbitrary code in the compromised system. The packages continue to be available for download from npm, and have been downloaded over 3,200 times to date. The discovery heralds a new trend where threat actors are using rogue npm packages as a way to introduce malicious modifications to other legitimate libraries or software already installed on developer systems.
SysAid Patches 4 Flaws That Enable Pre-Auth RCE — Multiple security flaws in the on-premise version of SysAid IT support software could be chained to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution with elevated privileges. The flaws, tracked as CVE-2025-2775, CVE-2025-2776, CVE-2025-2777 (CVSS scores: 9.3), and CVE-2025-2778, have been addressed in version 24.4.60 b16 of the software.
Hackers Exploit Samsung MagicINFO, GeoVision IoT Flaws in Mirai Attacks — Threat actors are exploiting security flaws in GeoVision end-of-life (EoL) Internet of Things (IoT) devices and an unpatched vulnerability affecting Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server to co-opt them into a Mirai botnet variant for conducting DDoS attacks. Users are advised to upgrade their GeoVision devices to a supported model and disconnect Samsung MagicINFO 9 Server instances from the public internet.
DoJ Charges Yemeni National for Deploying Black Kingdom Ransomware — The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announced charges against a 36-year-old Yemeni national named Rami Khaled Ahmed for allegedly deploying the Black Kingdom ransomware against global targets, including businesses, schools, and hospitals in the United States, between March 2021 to June 2023. Ahmed is accused of developing and deploying the ransomware by exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Exchange Server known as ProxyLogon. A report published by Kaspersky in June 2021 described the ransomware as ""amateurish"" and lacking in complexity and sophistication associated with major ransomware schemes.
Golden Chickens Return with TerraStealerV2 and TerraLogger Malware — Cybercriminal group Golden Chickens is back in the spotlight, this time with a fresh set of tools to steal credentials, cryptocurrency wallet data, browser extension information, and keystrokes. The findings represent the latest evidence of the threat actor's ongoing efforts to evolve their malware-as-a-service (MaaS) offerings. Golden Chickens, also called Venom Spider, has long been tied to the More_eggs malware. Unlike its data-sucking counterpart TerraStealerV2, TerraLogger takes a simpler but no less dangerous approach by capturing keystrokes entered by the victim on their machine. The fact that it lacks a data exfiltration mechanism suggests that it's likely being used as a module as part of their broader toolset.

Bluetooth SIG Releases Bluetooth 6.1 — The Bluetooth Special Interest Group has announced the release of Bluetooth 6.1 with improved device privacy via Resolvable Private Addresses (RPA). The feature enables ""randomizing the timing of address changes [and] makes it much more difficult for third-parties to track or correlate device activity over time,"" the SIG said.
AI Slop Leads to Rise in Fake Bug Reports — Software supply chain security firm Socket is warning of a rise in artificial intelligence (AI)-generated fake vulnerability reports impacting bug bounty programs that cite non-existent functions, include unverified patch suggestions, and highlight flaws that could not be reproduced. A consequence of this deliberate misuse is that it could cause bug bounty initiatives to operate in an effective manner. ""They divert limited attention from real vulnerabilities, add friction between maintainers and researchers, and chip away at the trust these programs depend on,"" the company said. Curl project founder Daniel Stenberg, in a post on LinkedIn, said ""I'm putting my foot down on this craziness,"" and that every reporter who submits reports deemed AI slop will be instantly banned. ""A threshold has been reached,"" Stenberg said. ""We are effectively being DDoSed. If we could, we would charge them for this waste of our time. We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help.""
AgeoStealer Stealer Disguises as a Video Game — A new information stealer called AgeoStealer has been observed using a website hosted on the Blogger platform, masquerading as a video game named Lomina to trick users into installing it. ""By targeting browsers, authentication tokens, and system files, it enables cybercriminals to perform identity theft, corporate espionage, and unauthorized financial transactions,"" Flashpoint said. ""Additionally, the use of PowerShell process termination, combined with sandbox evasion tactics, makes it particularly difficult to detect through traditional antivirus solutions.""
South Korea says DeepSeek Transferred User Data to China and the U.S. Without Consent — South Korea's data protection authority, the Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC), has accused Chinese AI service DeepSeek of transferring the personal data of its users to companies located in China and the United States without obtaining their consent. This included device, network, app information, and prompts to a Chinese cloud service platform named Volcano Engine. Although the PIPC identified Volcano Engine as an affiliate of ByteDance, the watchdog said it is a ""separate legal entity."" The findings are the result of an investigation the PIPC launched in February 2025.
Iranian Cyber Actors Impersonate a German Model Agency — Iranian threat actors have been linked to covert infrastructure (""megamodelstudio[.]com"") impersonating a German model agency. The site is designed to trigger the execution of malicious JavaScript that, unbeknownst to the visitors, gathers their browser languages, screen resolutions, IP addresses, and browser fingerprints likely in an attempt to facilitate further selective targeting. The activity has been attributed with low confidence to Agent Serpens (aka Charming Kitten), a threat actor known for its elaborate social engineering campaigns. The findings come as an Iran state-backed threat group dubbed Lemon Sandstorm targeted a critical national infrastructure (CNI) provider in a rival Middle Eastern nation and spread malicious software into its network over the past two years. The hacking group, per Fortinet, demonstrated operational security by taking pains to establish stealthy persistence for long periods and repeatedly trying various methods to infiltrate the network again after they were caught and eradicated.
Mozilla Streamlines Data Consent Experience for Firefox Add-ons — Browser maker Mozilla said it's making available a new feature in Firefox Nightly version 139 that introduces a new data consent experience for extensions in order to ""allow users to consent to share data with extensions directly in the Firefox add-on installation flow itself — rather than during a separate post-install experience and asking developers to build their own custom consent experiences."" As part of the changes, Mozilla has created broad categories based on data types used by extensions, such as personal data and technical and user interaction data. Extension developers can specify what data they wish to collect or transmit in their extension's manifest.json file. During installation, the manifest information will be parsed by the browser and shown to the user. Users can then choose to accept or reject the data collection.
ChoiceJacking Attack Bypass Existing Juice Jacking Defenses to Steal Data — Juice jacking attacks happen when hackers infect a charger with hidden malware that can steal sensitive data from phones connected to it. While mobile operating systems have since introduced new confirmation prompts for data connections from a USB host to a mobile device, a newly devised platform-agnostic attack technique from the Graz University of Technology has been found to sidestep existing mitigations that allows a malicious charger to autonomously spoof user input to enable its own data connection. ""Despite vendor customizations in USB stacks, ChoiceJacking attacks gain access to sensitive user files (pictures, documents, app data) on all tested devices from 8 vendors including the top 6 by market share,"" researchers Florian Draschbacher, Lukas Maar, Mathias Oberhuber, and Stefan Mangard said. ""For two vendors, our attacks allow file extraction from locked devices."" Apple, Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi have all acknowledged the attacks and have released fixes with iOS 18.4 (CVE-2025-24193) and Android 15 (CVE-2024-43085). The issue is being tracked for Samsung and Xiaomi under the CVE identifiers CVE-2024-20900 and CVE-2024-54096, respectively.
Threat Actors Target IIS Servers with Gh0st RAT — Suspected Chinese-speaking threat actors have been observed targeting poorly secured IIS web servers in South Korea with a malicious IIS module. ""When the malicious IIS native module is loaded into the w3wp.exe process, it intercepts all HTTP requests being sent to the web server,"" AhnLab said. ""It then manipulates the response values to redirect to a specific page or perform a web shell function. Through the malicious native module, threat actors can intercept all traffic coming into the web server and modify it as needed."" The attack is notable for the use of a .NET-based web shell and Gh0st RAT, a remote access trojan widely used by Chinese hacking groups. ""By installing their malicious modules on the web server, the threat actor was able to insert their affiliate links into the response values to the HTTP traffic requested from the web server,"" the company said. ""This allowed them to generate revenue by displaying their advertisements and banners on their partner websites. Additionally, the threat actor used the malware to install phishing pages and redirect users to them, thereby leaking sensitive information.""
Microsoft Begins Enforcing New Outlook Rules for Bulk Emails — Microsoft has begun enacting stricter rules that domains sending more than 5,000 emails per day are required to follow. This includes mandatory SPF, DKIM, DMARC settings, functional unsubscribe links, transparent mailing practices, and email bounce management. ""These measures will help reduce spoofing, phishing, and spam activity, empowering legitimate senders with stronger brand protection and better deliverability,"" the company said.
Japan Warns of Threat Actors Using Hijacked Financial Accounts to Conduct Trades — Weeks after Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) alerted users of unauthorized transactions on internet stock trading services using stolen credentials harvested from phishing websites, the agency revealed that the hackers have conducted more than $1 billion in sales and purchases of about $902 billion since the start of the year. A total of 18 companies are impacted, with 3,505 transactions reported to date.
New Scam Exploits X Advertising Loophole — Threat actors are taking advantage of a loophole in X's ads policy to conduct a financial scam that employs ads with the display URL spoofing ""cnn[.]com"" but, when clicked, redirects visitors to a crypto scam website impersonating Apple's brand (""ipresale[.]world""). ""The scam encourages visitors to create an account and buy a token positioned as coming from Apple; the website also includes a fake testimonial from Apple CEO Tim Cook,"" Silent Push said. The findings coincide with the discovery of a recruitment scam that singles out job seekers with offers of flexible opportunities that entice them into depositing their own funds in order to complete a series of tasks and earn a cryptocurrency payment. ""After enticing victims to their phishing website with the promise of substantial remuneration, the threat actor then coerces them into making up-front payments to engage in the tasks that supposedly release that remuneration,"" Netcraft said. A similar campaign was documented by Proofpoint in October 2024.
Crypto Heist Uncovers New Malware — An investigation into a large-scale cryptocurrency theft with losses exceeding $1 million has led to the discovery of two new malware families named PRELUDE and DELPHYS. PRELUDE is a .NET backdoor that can launch a reverse shell and take screenshots. DELPHYS, on the other hand, is a 64-bit Delphi loader distributed in EXE form, and is used to execute the Havoc command-and-control (C2) framework. The campaign, per Kroll, was initiated via social engineering over a direct message on X, after which the victim was directed to a Discord server to download the malware. The activity, tracked as KTA440, is assessed to be a highly targeted campaign aimed at individuals of high net worth in the cryptocurrency space.
India-Pakistan Military Conflict Sparks Cyber Attacks — The recent military conflict between India and Pakistan has led to a surge in attacks targeting both countries. Cybersecurity company NSFOCUS said it observed a 500% rise in cyberattacks targeting India and a 700% rise against targets in Pakistan towards the end of April 2025. There has also been an increase in hacktivist activity targeting India in the form of DDoS attacks, led by RipperSec, AnonSec, Keymous+, Sylhet Gang, and Mr Hamza. However, according to CloudSEK, a majority of the claims of hacktivist campaigns targeting Indian digital infrastructure are ""significantly overblown."" That's not all. The rising military tensions have been capitalized by the Pakistan-linked Transparent Tribe (aka APT36) threat actor, which has employed spear-phishing and ClickFix-style lures to deliver Crimson RAT and a .NET-based loader, respectively.
CISA Releases Guidance to Mitigate OT Threats from Unsophisticated Cyber Actors — The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Department of Energy (DOE) are urging critical infrastructure entities to review and take steps to bolster their security posture amid ""cyber incidents affecting the operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICS) of critical infrastructure entities in the United States."" This includes removing OT connections to the public internet, changing default passwords, securing remote access to OT networks, and segmenting IT and OT networks. ""Although these activities often include basic and elementary intrusion techniques, the presence of poor cyber hygiene and exposed assets can escalate these threats, leading to significant consequences such as defacement, configuration changes, operational disruptions and, in severe cases, physical damage,"" the agencies said.
LockBit Ransomware Admin Panel Hacked — In a further blow to LockBit's operations, the ransomware scheme's dark web affiliate panels were hacked and defaced with the message ""Don't do crime CRIME IS BAD xoxo from Prague."" The panel has also been made available to download in SQL database format, revealing custom ransomware builds, a list of 75 admins and affiliates who had access to the affiliate panel, 59,975 unique bitcoin addresses, and more than 4,400 victim negotiation messages from December 2024 to the end of April 2025. ""The leaked chats reveal a fascinating twist – attackers offer up to 20% discounts to victims who choose to pay in Monero instead of Bitcoin,"" Qualys said. ""This isn't just a random perk; it signals a deliberate preference for Monero, likely due to its privacy-centric design."" LockBitSupp, LockBit's main administrator, has since confirmed the hack. While LockBit has continued to operate despite law enforcement action, the latest leak may sound the death knell for what was once the most prolific ransomware group.

Unofficial Signal App Used by Trump Government Officials Probes Hack — TeleMessage, an Israeli company that sells an unofficial Signal message archiving tool used by some U.S. government officials, has suspended all services after reportedly being hacked. Details of the hack emerged in the wake of a 404 Media report revealed an anonymous hacker had breached TeleMessage and gained access to direct messages and group chats archived using TM SGNL, TeleMessage's unofficial Signal clone, alongside WhatsApp, Telegram, and WeChat.

Cybersecurity Tip of the Week: Block AI Bots from Scraping Your Website → AI companies are quietly crawling websites to collect content for training their models. If you run a company blog, research portal, or any site with original content, it's likely being indexed—often without your consent.
You can reduce this risk by adding a simple robots.txt rule that tells known AI crawlers to stay out. It doesn't block rogue scrapers, but it does stop most major bots like GPTBot (OpenAI), AnthropicBot, and CCBot (Common Crawl), which power many commercial AI systems.
Add this to your site's robots.txt file:
User-agent: GPTBot
Disallow: /
User-agent: AnthropicBot
Disallow: /
User-agent: CCBot
Disallow: /
This file must live at yourdomain[.]com/robots.txt. For extra visibility, monitor your server logs for unexpected crawlers. In an era where data is currency, limiting unauthorized use of your content is a simple, proactive security move.

This week underscored a fundamental reality: cyber risk is no longer just a technical problem—it's a business, legal, and reputational one. From criminal indictments tied to ransomware operations, to flawed software policies that enable phishing through official ad platforms, the consequences are moving upstream.
Security decisions are leadership decisions now, and the organizations that act accordingly will be the ones that endure when the next breach hits close."
2025-05-20 02:15:00,"May 12, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/the-persistence-problem-why-exposed.html,The Persistence Problem: Why Exposed Credentials Remain Unfixed—and How to Change That,"Detecting leaked credentials is only half the battle. The real challenge—and often the neglected half of the equation—is what happens after detection. New research from GitGuardian's State of Secrets Sprawl 2025 report reveals a disturbing trend: the vast majority of exposed company secrets discovered in public repositories remain valid for years after detection, creating an expanding attack surface that many organizations are failing to address.
According to GitGuardian's analysis of exposed secrets across public GitHub repositories, an alarming percentage of credentials detected as far back as 2022 remain valid today:

""Detecting a leaked secret is just the first step,"" says GitGuardian's research team. ""The true challenge lies in swift remediation.""
Why Exposed Secrets Remain Valid#
This persistent validity suggests two troubling possibilities: either organizations are unaware their credentials have been exposed (a security visibility problem), or they lack the resources, processes, or urgency to properly remediate them (a security operations problem). In both cases, a concerning observation is that those secrets are not even routinely revoked, neither automatically from default expiration, nor manually as part of regular rotation procedures.
Organizations either remain unaware of exposed credentials or lack the resources to address them effectively. Hardcoded secrets proliferate across codebases, making comprehensive remediation challenging. Secret rotation requires coordinated updates across services and systems, often with production impact. 
Resource constraints force prioritization of only the highest-risk exposures, while legacy systems create technical barriers by not supporting modern approaches like ephemeral credentials.
This combination of limited visibility, operational complexity, and technical limitations explains why hardcoded secrets often remain valid long after exposure. Moving to modern secrets security solutions with centralized, automated systems and short-lived credentials is now an operational necessity, not just a security best practice.
Which Services Are Most At Risk? The trends#
Behind the raw statistics lies an alarming reality: critical production systems remain vulnerable due to exposed credentials that persist for years in public repositories. 
Analysis of exposed secrets from 2022-2024 reveals that database credentials, cloud keys, and API tokens for essential services continue to remain valid long after their initial exposure. These are not test or development credentials but authentic keys to production environments, representing direct pathways for attackers to access sensitive customer data, infrastructure, and business-critical systems.
Sensitive Services Still Exposed (2022–2024):#

MongoDB: Attackers can use these to exfiltrate or corrupt data. These are highly sensitive, offering potential attackers access to personally identifiable information or technical insight that can be used for privilege escalation or lateral movement.
Google Cloud, AWS, Tencent Cloud: these cloud keys grant potential attackers access to infrastructure, code, and customer data.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: these database credentials persist in public code each year as well.

These are not test credentials, but keys to live services.

Over the past three years, the landscape of exposed secrets in public repositories has shifted in ways that reveal both progress and new risks, especially for cloud and database credentials. Once again, these trends reflect only the ones that have been found and are still valid—meaning they have not been remediated or revoked despite being publicly exposed.
For cloud credentials, the data shows a marked upward trend. In 2023, valid cloud credentials accounted for just under 10% of all still-active exposed secrets. By 2024, that share had surged to almost 16%. This increase likely reflects the growing adoption of cloud infrastructure and SaaS in enterprise environments, but it also underscores the ongoing struggle many organizations face in managing cloud access securely—especially as developer velocity and complexity increase.
In contrast, database credential exposures moved in the opposite direction. In 2023, valid database credentials made up over 13% of the unremediated secrets detected, but by 2024, that figure dropped to less than 7%. This decline could indicate that awareness and remediation efforts around database credentials—particularly following high-profile breaches and increased use of managed database services—are starting to pay off.
The overall takeaway is nuanced: while organizations may be getting better at protecting traditional database secrets, the rapid rise in valid, unremediated cloud credential exposures suggests that new types of secrets are taking their place as the most prevalent and risky. As cloud-native architectures become the norm, the need for automated secrets management, short-lived credentials, and rapid remediation is more urgent than ever.
Practical Remediation Strategies for High-Risk Credentials#
To reduce the risk posed by exposed MongoDB credentials, organizations should act quickly to rotate any that may have leaked and set up IP allowlisting to strictly limit who can access the database. Enabling audit logging is also key for detecting suspicious activity in real time and helping with investigations after a breach. For longer-term security, move away from hardcoded passwords by leveraging dynamic secrets. If you use MongoDB Atlas, programmatic access to the password rotation is possible through the API so that you can make your CI/CD pipelines routinely rotate secrets, even if you haven't detected an exposure.
Google Cloud Keys#
If a Google Cloud key is ever found exposed, the safest move is immediate revocation. To prevent future risk, transition from static service account keys to modern, short-lived authentication methods: use Workload Identity Federation for external workloads, attach service accounts directly to Google Cloud resources, or implement service account impersonation when user access is required. Enforce regular key rotation and apply least privilege principles to all service accounts to minimize the potential impact of any exposure.
AWS IAM Credentials#
For AWS IAM credentials, immediate rotation is essential if exposure is suspected. The best long-term defense is to eliminate long-lived user access keys entirely, opting for IAM Roles and AWS STS to provide temporary credentials for workloads. For systems outside AWS, leverage IAM Roles Anywhere. Routinely audit your access policies with AWS IAM Access Analyzer and enable AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive logging, so you can quickly spot and respond to any suspicious credential usage.
By adopting these modern secrets management practices—focusing on short-lived, dynamic credentials and automation—organizations can significantly reduce the risks posed by exposed secrets and make remediation a routine, manageable process rather than a fire drill.
Secret Managers integrations can also help to solve this task automatically.
Conclusion#
The persistent validity of exposed secrets represents a significant and often overlooked security risk. While detection is essential, organizations must prioritize rapid remediation and shift toward architectures that minimize the impact of credential exposure.
As our data shows, the problem is getting worse, not better—with more secrets remaining valid longer after exposure. By implementing proper secret management practices and moving away from long-lived credentials, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and mitigate the impact of inevitable exposures.

""Instead of relying on traditional phishing or cracked software sites, they build convincing AI-themed platforms – often advertised via legitimate-looking Facebook groups and viral social media campaigns,"" Morphisec researcher Shmuel Uzan said in a report published last week.
Posts shared on these pages have been found to attract over 62,000 views on a single post, indicating that users looking for AI tools for video and image editing are the target of this campaign. Some of the fake social media pages identified include Luma Dreammachine Al, Luma Dreammachine, and gratistuslibros.
Users who land on the social media posts are urged to click on links that advertise AI-powered content creation services, including videos, logos, images, and even websites. One of the bogus websites masquerades as CapCut AI, offering users an ""all-in-one video editor with new AI features.""

Once unsuspecting users upload their image or video prompts on these sites, they are then asked to download the supposed AI-generated content, at which point a malicious ZIP archive (""VideoDreamAI.zip"") is downloaded instead.
Present within the file is a deceptive file named ""Video Dream MachineAI.mp4.exe"" that kick-starts the infection chain by launching a legitimate binary associated with ByteDance's video editor (""CapCut.exe""). This C++-based executable is used to run a .NET-based loader named CapCutLoader that, in turn, ultimately loads a Python payload (""srchost.exe"") from a remote server.
The Python binary paves the way for the deployment of Noodlophile Stealer, which comes with capabilities to harvest browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallet information, and other sensitive data. Select instances have also bundled the stealer with a remote access trojan like XWorm for entrenched access to the infected hosts.

The developer of Noodlophile is assessed to be of Vietnamese origin, who, on their GitHub profile, claims to be a ""passionate Malware Developer from Vietnam."" The account was created on March 16, 2025. It's worth pointing out that the Southeast Asian nation is home to a thriving cybercrime ecosystem that has a history of distributing various stealer malware families targeting Facebook.
Bad actors weaponizing public interest in AI technologies to their advantage is not a new phenomenon. In 2023, Meta said it took down more than 1,000 malicious URLs from being shared across its services that were found to leverage OpenAI's ChatGPT as a lure to propagate about 10 malware families since March 2023.

The disclosure comes as CYFIRMA detailed another new .NET-based stealer malware family codenamed PupkinStealer that can steal a wide range of data from compromised Windows systems and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot.
""With no specific anti-analysis defenses or persistence mechanisms, PupkinStealer depends on straightforward execution and low-profile behavior to avoid detection during its operation,"" the cybersecurity company said. ""PupkinStealer exemplifies a simple yet effective form of data-stealing malware that leverages common system behaviors and widely used platforms to exfiltrate sensitive information."""
2025-05-20 02:15:04,"May 10, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/google-pays-1375-billion-to-texas-over.html,Google Pays $1.375 Billion to Texas Over Unauthorized Tracking and Biometric Data Collection,"Google has agreed to pay the U.S. state of Texas nearly $1.4 billion to settle two lawsuits that accused the company of tracking users' personal location and maintaining their facial recognition data without consent.
The $1.375 billion payment dwarfs the fines the tech giant has paid to settle similar lawsuits brought by other U.S. states. In November 2022, it paid $391 million to a group of 40 states. In January 2023, it paid $29.5 million to Indiana and Washington. Later that September, it forked out another $93 million to settle with California.

The case, originally filed in 2022, related to unlawful tracking and collection of user data, regarding geolocation, incognito searches, and biometric data, tracking users' whereabouts even when the Location History setting was disabled and collecting the biometric data without informed consent.
""For years, Google secretly tracked people's movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement.
""This $1.375 billion settlement is a major win for Texans' privacy and tells companies that they will pay for abusing our trust.""
Last year, Google announced plans to store Maps Timeline data locally on users' devices instead of their Google accounts. The company has also rolled out other privacy controls that allow users to auto-delete location information when the Location History setting is enabled.

The payment also rivals a $1.4 billion fine that Meta paid Texas to settle a lawsuit over allegations that it illegally collected the biometric data of millions of users without their permission.
The development comes at a time when Google is the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, facing calls to break up parts of its business to satisfy antitrust concerns."
2025-05-20 02:15:06,"May 10, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/germany-shuts-down-exch-over-19b.html,"Germany Shuts Down eXch Over $1.9B Laundering, Seizes €34M in Crypto and 8TB of Data","Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office (aka Bundeskriminalamt or BKA) has seized the online infrastructure and shutdown linked to the eXch cryptocurrency exchange over allegations of money laundering and operating a criminal trading platform.
The operation was carried out on April 30, 2025, authorities said, adding they also confiscated 8 terabytes worth of data and cryptocurrency assets worth €34 million ($38.25 million) in Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Dash.
According to the BKA, eXch[.]cx, existed since 2014 and offered cryptocurrency swapping services, allowing its users to exchange digital assets. It was available both on the clearnet and the dark web.
eXch ""specifically advertised on platforms of the criminal underground economy (UE) that it did not implement any anti-money laundering measures,"" the BKA said in a statement.

""Users were neither required to identify themselves to the service, nor was user data stored there. Crypto swapping via eXch was therefore particularly suitable for concealing financial flows.""
Cryptocurrency assets worth an estimated $1.9 billion are estimated to have been transferred using the service since its launch. This also includes a portion of the illicit proceeds (about $200 million of the $1.46 billion) gained by North Korean threat actors following the Bybit hack earlier this year.
The development comes as eXch announced its own plans on April 17 to cease their operations effective this month, prompting the authorities to secure ""numerous pieces of evidence and leads.""
In a message posted on the BitcoinTalk forum, eXch said it was shutting down after it ""received confirmation of information"" that the platform is the ""subject of an active transatlantic operation aimed at forcibly shutting our project down and prosecuting us for 'money laundering and terrorism.'""

""The goals we certainly never had in mind were to enable illicit activities such as money laundering or terrorism, as we are being accused of now,"" it claimed. ""We also have absolutely no motivation to operate a project where we are viewed as criminals. This doesn't make any sense to us.""
In a report published on May 2, blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs said it observed on-chain activity pertaining to child sexual abuse material (CSAM) threat actors and that the service has been directly exposed to more than $300,000 in CSAM-related funds.
""Although eXch publicly positioned itself as a privacy-focused exchange, it developed a reputation for obstructing ecosystem accountability,"" the company said. ""This was demonstrated by it refusing to assist Bybit in freezing funds potentially connected to its hack.""

Following the takedown, the Dutch Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD) said in a message that it's ""actively investigating individuals involved in money laundering and other illegal activities through this swap service.""
""We want to make one thing clear: this action is not an attack on privacy. We respect the right to privacy and recognize its importance in the digital age. However, when services are heavily abused to commit crime, we will act,"" it added.
""We urge everyone involved in illicit activity to cease immediately. The legal consequences can be serious. Privacy is not the problem – criminal misuse is."""
2025-05-20 02:15:07,"May 09, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/breaking-7000-device-proxy-botnet-using.html,"BREAKING: 7,000-Device Proxy Botnet Using IoT, EoL Systems Dismantled in U.S. - Dutch Operation","A joint law enforcement operation undertaken by Dutch and U.S. authorities has dismantled a criminal proxy network that's powered by thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) and end-of-life (EoL) devices, enlisting them into a botnet for providing anonymity to malicious actors.
In conjunction with the domain seizure, Russian nationals, Alexey Viktorovich Chertkov, 37, Kirill Vladimirovich Morozov, 41, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Shishkin, 36, and Dmitriy Rubtsov, 38, a Kazakhstani national, have been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) for operating, maintaining, and profiting from the proxy services.
The DoJ noted that users paid a monthly subscription fee, ranging from $9.95 to $110 per month, netting the threat actors more than $46 million by selling access to the infected routers. The service is believed to have been available since 2004.

It also said the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) found business and residential routers in Oklahoma that had been hacked to install malware without the users' knowledge.
""A weekly average of 1,000 unique bots in contact with the command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, located in Turkey,"" Lumen Technologies Black Lotus Labs said in a report shared with The Hacker News. ""Over half of these victims are in the United States, with Canada and Ecuador showing the next two highest totals.""

The services in question – anyproxy.net and 5socks.net – have been disrupted as part of an effort codenamed Operation Moonlander. Lumen told The Hacker News that both the platforms point to the ""same botnet, selling under two different named services.""
Snapshots captured on the Internet Archive show that 5socks.net advertised ""more than 7,000 online proxies daily"" spanning various countries and states of the U.S., enabling threat actors to anonymously carry out a wide range of illicit activity in exchange for a cryptocurrency payment.

Lumen said the compromised devices were infected with a malware called TheMoon, which has also fueled another criminal proxy service referred to as Faceless. The company has also taken the step of disrupting the infrastructure by null routing all traffic to and from their known control points.
""The two services were essentially the same pool of proxies and C2s, and besides that malware, they were using a variety of exploits that were useful against EoL devices,"" Lumen told The Hacker News. ""However the proxy services themselves are unrelated [to Faceless].""
It is suspected that the operators of the botnet relied on known exploits to breach EoL devices and rope them into the proxy botnet. Newly added bots have been found to contact a Turkey-based C2 infrastructure consisting of five servers, out of which four are designed to communicate with the infected victims on port 80.

""One of these 5 servers uses UDP on port 1443 to receive victim traffic, while not sending any in return,"" the cybersecurity company said. ""We suspect this server is used to store information from their victims.""
In an advisory issued by the FBI Thursday, the agency said the threat actors behind the botnets have exploited known security vulnerabilities in internet-exposed routers to install malware that grants persistent remote access.
The FBI also pointed out that the EoL routers have been compromised with a variant of TheMoon malware, permitting the threat actors to install proxy software on the devices and help conduct cyber crimes anonymously. TheMoon was first documented by the SANS Technology Institute in 2014 in attacks targeting Linksys routers.

""TheMoon does not require a password to infect routers; it scans for open ports and sends a command to a vulnerable script,"" the FBI said. ""The malware contacts the command-and-control (C2) server and the C2 server responds with instructions, which may include instructing the infected machine to scan for other vulnerable routers to spread the infection and expand the network.""
When users purchase a proxy, they receive an IP and port combination for connection. Just like in the case of NSOCKS, the service lacks any additional authentication once activated, making it ripe for abuse. It has been found that 5socks.net has been used to conduct ad fraud, DDoS and brute-force attacks, and exploit victim's data.
To mitigate the risks posed by such proxy botnets, users are advised to regularly reboot routers, install security updates, change default passwords, and upgrade to newer models once they reach EoL status.
""Proxy services have and will continue to present a direct threat to internet security as they allow malicious actors to hide behind unsuspecting residential IPs, complicating detection by network monitoring tools,"" Lumen said.
""As a vast number of end-of-life devices remain in circulation, and the world continues to adopt devices in the 'Internet of Things,' there will continue to be a massive pool of targets for malicious actors."""
2025-05-20 02:15:11,"May 09, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/ottercookie-v4-adds-vm-detection-and.html,"OtterCookie v4 Adds VM Detection and Chrome, MetaMask Credential Theft Capabilities","The North Korean threat actors behind the Contagious Interview campaign have been observed using updated versions of a cross-platform malware called OtterCookie with capabilities to steal credentials from web browsers and other files.
NTT Security Holdings, which detailed the new findings, said the attackers have ""actively and continuously"" updated the malware, introducing versions v3 and v4 in February and April 2025, respectively.
The Japanese cybersecurity company is tracking the cluster under the name WaterPlum, which is also known as CL-STA-0240, DeceptiveDevelopment, DEV#POPPER, Famous Chollima, PurpleBravo, and Tenacious Pungsan.
OtterCookie was first documented by NTT last year after having observed it in attacks since September 2024. Delivered by means of a JavaScript payload via a malicious npm package, trojanized GitHub or Bitbucket repository, or a bogus videoconferencing app, it's designed to contact an external server to execute commands on compromised hosts.
OtterCookie v3 has been found to incorporate a new upload module to send files matching a predefined set of extensions to the external server. This consists of environment variables, images, documents, spreadsheets, text files, and files containing mnemonic and recovery phrases associated with cryptocurrency wallets.
It's worth pointing out that this module was previously executed in OtterCookie v2 as a shell command received from the server.
The fourth iteration of the malware expands on its predecessor by adding two more modules to steal credentials from Google Chrome, as well as extract data from the MetaMask extension for Google Chrome, Brave browser, and iCloud Keychain.
Another new feature addition to OtterCookie v4 is the ability to detect if it's being executed in virtual machine (VM) environments pertaining to Broadcom VMware, Oracle VirtualBox, Microsoft, and QEMU.

Interestingly, it has been found that the first stealer module responsible for gathering Google Chrome credentials does so after decrypting them, whereas the second module harvests encrypted login data from browsers like Chrome and Brave.
""This difference in data processing or coding style implies that these modules were developed by different developers,"" researchers Masaya Motoda and Rintaro Koike said.
The disclosure comes as multiple malicious payloads related to the Contagious Interview campaign have been unearthed in recent months, indicating that the threat actors are refining their modus operandi.

This includes a Go-based information stealer that's delivered under the guise of a Realtek driver update (""WebCam.zip"") that, when opened, runs a shell script responsible for downloading the stealer and launching a deceptive macOS application (""DriverMinUpdate.app"") engineered to harvest the victim's macOS system password.
It's believed that the malware was distributed as part of an updated version of the activity codenamed ClickFake Interview by Sekoia last month owing to the use of ClickFix-style lures to fix non-existent audio and video issues during an online assessment for a job interview process.
""The stealer's primary role is to establish a persistent C2 channel, profile the infected system, and exfiltrate sensitive data,"" MacPaw's cybersecurity division, Moonlock, said. ""It achieves this through a combination of system reconnaissance, credential theft, and remote command execution.""
It's assessed that the application DriverMinUpdate is part of a larger set of similar malicious apps that have been uncovered by dmpdump, SentinelOne, ENKI, and Kandji such as ChromeUpdateAlert, ChromeUpdate, CameraAccess, and DriverEasy.

A second new malware family connected to the campaign is Tsunami-Framework, which is delivered as a follow-up payload to a known Python backdoor referred to as InvisibleFerret. A .NET-based modular malware, it's equipped to steal a wide range of data from web browsers and cryptocurrency wallets.
It also incorporates features to log keystrokes, collect files, and even a botnet component that appears to be under early development, German security company HiSolutions said in a report published late last month. 
Contagious Interview, per ESET, is believed to be a new activity cluster that's part of the Lazarus Group, a notorious hacking group from North Korea that has a storied history of orchestrating both espionage- and financially-motivated attacks as a way to advance the nation's strategic goals and sidestep international sanctions.
Earlier this year, the adversarial collective was attributed to the record-breaking billion-dollar heist from cryptocurrency platform Bybit.
The North Korean IT Worker Threat Endures#
The findings come as cybersecurity company Sophos revealed that the threat actors behind the fraudulent IT worker scheme from North Korea -- also known as Famous Chollima, Nickel Tapestry, and Wagemole -- have begun to increasingly target organizations in Europe and Asia, and industries beyond the technology sector to secure jobs and funnel the proceeds back to Pyongyang.
To pull off the scheme, the threat actors are known to flood job sites such as Xing, Upwork, Toptal, and 9am with fabricated profiles, complete with corresponding social media profiles on sites like LinkedIn using AI-generated versions of stock images. 
""Throughout the pre-employment phase, the threat actors often digitally manipulate photos for their falsified resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and to accompany prior work history or group project claims,"" the company's Secureworks Counter Threat Unit (CTU) said.
""They commonly use stock photos overlaid with real images of themselves. The threat actors have also increased usage of generative AI, including writing tools, image-editing tools, and resume builders.""
The fraudulent workers, upon landing a job, have also been found using mouse jiggler utilities, VPN software like Astrill VPN, and KVM over IP for remote access, in some cases even resorting to eight-hour-long Zoom calls for screen sharing. 
Cybersecurity firm ReliaQuest said it found a ""recurring trend"" in their multi-factor authentication (MFA) devices where Chinese-made brands like Oppo and Vivo were frequently identified and that it uncovered multiple North Korean insiders authenticating from the same fixed-line IP address.
""North Korean state-sponsored operatives are infiltrating Western companies by posing as skilled IT workers, particularly in full-stack web development roles,"" it pointed out in a fresh report spotlighting the threat actors' tradecraft.
""Using fake AI-generated profiles, stolen identities, and tools like Astrill VPN and IP-KVM devices, these operatives fund North Korea's weapons programs while staying under the radar. Their tactics exploit vulnerabilities like BYOD policies, highlighting the growing sophistication of North Korean cyber operations and the urgent need for robust candidate vetting and geo-based login monitoring.""
Last week, cryptocurrency exchange platform Kraken disclosed how a routine job interview for an engineering position turned into an intelligence-gathering operation after it spotted a North Korean hacker attempting to infiltrate the company using the name Steven Smith.
""The candidate used remote colocated Mac desktops but interacted with other components through a VPN, a setup commonly deployed to hide location and network activity,"" the company said. ""Their resume was linked to a GitHub profile containing an email address exposed in a past data breach.""

""The candidate's primary form of ID appeared to be altered, likely using details stolen in an identity theft case two years prior.""
But instead of rejecting the candidate's application outright, Kraken said its security and recruitment teams ""strategically"" advanced them through its interview process as way a to trap them by asking them to confirm their location, hold up a government-issued ID, and recommend some local restaurants in the city they claimed to be in.
""Flustered and caught off guard, they struggled with the basic verification tests, and couldn't convincingly answer real-time questions about their city of residence or country of citizenship,"" Kraken said. ""By the end of the interview, the truth was clear: this was not a legitimate applicant, but an imposter attempting to infiltrate our systems.""
In another case documented by the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) last month, a 40-year-old Maryland man, Minh Phuong Ngoc Vong, pleaded guilty to fraud after securing a job with a government contractor and then outsourcing the work to a North Korean national residing in Shenyang, China – underscoring the severity of the illicit fundraising activity.
North Korea's ability to stealthily slip thousands of its workers into major companies, often with the help of facilitators who run what's called a laptop farm, has led to repeated warnings from Japanese, South Korean, U.K., and U.S. governments.
Sarah Kern, CTU North Korea and Emerging Threats Lead at Sophos, told the Hacker News that facilitators have been recruited via LinkedIn or freelance job market services.
""Often, the recruited facilitators had accounts on these sites for legitimate employment opportunities before ultimately becoming an accomplice in the scheme,"" Kern explained. ""The threat actors have asked various facilitators for a wide array of tasks such as interviewing for jobs on their behalf, receiving corporate laptop deliveries, falsifying official documents, and routing paychecks.""
These workers have been found to spend up to 14 months inside an organization, with the threat actors also engaging in data theft and extortion threats following termination.
""However, extortion intentions were not displayed in the first few years of NICKEL TAPESTRY operations,"" Kern said. ""Monetary desperation, level of access to sensitive data, and the value/prosperity of a long-running fake persona can all influence the threat actor's motivations as a fraudulent employee.""
""Organizations [should] establish enhanced identity verification procedures as part of their interview process,"" Sophos said. ""Human resources staff and recruiters should be regularly updated on tactics used in these campaigns to help them identify potential fraudulent North Korean IT workers.""
""Additionally, organizations should monitor for traditional insider threat activity, suspicious usage of legitimate tools, and impossible travel alerts to detect activity often associated with fraudulent workers.""
(The story was updated after publication on May 14, 2025, to include additional insights shared by Sophos.)"

""The spam message uses the Brazilian electronic invoice system, NF-e, as a lure to entice users into clicking hyperlinks and accessing malicious content hosted in Dropbox,"" Cisco Talos researcher Guilherme Venere said in a Thursday report.
The attack chains begin with specially crafted spam emails that claim to originate from financial institutions or cell phone carriers, warning of overdue bills or outstanding payments in order to trick users into clicking on bogus Dropbox links that point to a binary installer for the RMM tool.
Two notable RMM tools observed are N-able RMM Remote Access and PDQ Connect, granting attackers the ability to read and write files to the remote file system.
In some cases, the threat actors then use the remote capabilities of these agents to download and install an additional RMM software such as ScreenConnect after the initial compromise.
Based on the common recipients observed, the campaign has been found to mainly target C-level executives and financial and human resources account across several industries, including some educational and government institutions.
It has also been assessed with high confidence that the activity is the work of an initial access broker (IAB) that's abusing the free trial periods associated with various RMM programs to gain unauthorized access. N-able has since taken steps to disable the affected trial accounts.

""Adversaries' abuse of commercial RMM tools has steadily increased in recent years,"" Venere said. ""These tools are of interest to threat actors because they are usually digitally signed by recognized entities and are a fully featured backdoor.""
""They also have little to no cost in software or infrastructure, as all of this is generally provided by the trial version application.""
The development comes amid the emergence of various phishing campaigns that are engineered to sidestep modern defenses and propagate a wide range of malware families, or collect victims' credentials -

A campaign conducted by a South American cybercrime group called Hive0148 to distribute the Grandoreiro banking trojan to users in users in Mexico and Costa Rica.
A campaign that employs a legitimate file-sharing service named GetShared to bypass security protections and direct users to links hosting malware
A campaign that uses sales order-themed lures to deliver the Formbook malware by means of a Microsoft Word document that's susceptible to a years-old flaw in Equation Editor (CVE-2017-11882)
A campaign that has targeted organizations in Spain, Italy, and Portugal using invoice-related themes to deploy a Java-based remote access trojan named Ratty RAT that can execute remote commands, log keystrokes, capture screenshots, and steal sensitive data
A campaign that uses a legitimate note-taking application known as Milanote and an adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) phishing kit dubbed Tycoon 2FA to capture users' credentials under the guise of viewing a ""new agreement""
Campaigns that utilize encoded JavaScript within SVG files, booby-trapped links in PDF attachments, dynamic phishing URLs that are rendered at runtime inside OneDrive-hosted files, and archived MHT payloads within OpenXML structures to direct users to credential harvesting or phishing pages
Campaigns that abuse Cloudflare's TryCloudflare tunneling feature to deploy malware like AsyncRAT

""Attackers continuously evolve tactics to bypass modern email and endpoint security solutions, making detecting and mitigating phishing attempts increasingly difficult,"" Intezer researcher Yuval Guri noted last month. ""And despite advancements in cybersecurity tools, many phishing campaigns still successfully reach users' inboxes."""

2025-05-20 02:15:15,"May 09, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/malicious-npm-packages-infect-3200.html,"Malicious npm Packages Infect 3,200+ Cursor Users With Backdoor, Steal Credentials","Cybersecurity researchers have flagged three malicious npm packages that are designed to target the Apple macOS version of Cursor, a popular artificial intelligence (AI)-powered source code editor.
""Disguised as developer tools offering 'the cheapest Cursor API,' these packages steal user credentials, fetch an encrypted payload from threat actor-controlled infrastructure, overwrite Cursor's main.js file, and disable auto-updates to maintain persistence,"" Socket researcher Kirill Boychenko said.
The packages in question are listed below -

sw-cur (2,771 downloads)
sw-cur1 (307 downloads), and
aiide-cur (163 downloads)

All three packages continue to be available for download from the npm registry. ""Aiide-cur"" was first published on February 14, 2025. It was uploaded by a user named ""aiide."" The npm library is described as a ""command-line tool for configuring the macOS version of the Cursor editor.""

The other two packages, per the software supply chain security firm, were published a day earlier by a threat actor under the alias ""gtr2018."" In total, the three packages have been downloaded over 3,200 times to date.
The libraries, once installed, are designed to harvest user-supplied Cursor credentials and fetch a next-stage payload from a remote server (""t.sw2031[.]com"" or ""api.aiide[.]xyz""), which is then used to replace a legitimate Cursor-specific code with malicious logic.
""Sw-cur"" also takes the step of disabling Cursor's auto-update mechanism and terminating all Cursor processes. The npm packages then proceed to restart the application so that the patched code takes effect, granting the threat actor to execute arbitrary code within the context of the platform.
The findings point to an emerging trend where threat actors are using rogue npm packages as a way to introduce malicious modifications to other legitimate libraries or software already installed on developer systems.
This is significant not least because it adds a new layer of sophistication by allowing the malware to persist even after the nefarious libraries have been removed, requiring developers to perform a clean install of the altered software again.
""Patch‑based compromise is a new and a powerful addition to the threat actor arsenal targeting open-source supply chains: Instead (or in addition) of slipping malware into a package manager, attackers publish a seemingly harmless npm package that rewrites code already trusted on the victim's machine,"" Socket told The Hacker News.
""By operating inside a legitimate parent process -- an IDE or shared library -- the malicious logic inherits the application's trust, maintains persistence even after the offending package is removed, and automatically gains whatever privileges that software holds, from API tokens and signing keys to outbound network access.""
""This campaign highlights a growing supply chain threat, with threat actors increasingly using malicious patches to compromise trusted local software,"" Boychenko said.
The selling point here is that the attackers are attempting to exploit developers' interest in AI as well as those who are looking for cheaper usage fees for access to AI models. 
""The threat actor's use of the tagline 'the cheapest Cursor API' likely targets this group, luring users with the promise of discounted access while quietly deploying a backdoor,"" the researcher added.
To counter such novel supply chain threats, defenders are required to flag packages that run postinstall scripts, modify files outside node_modules, or initiate unexpected network calls, and combining those indicators with rigorous version pinning, real‑time dependency scanning, and file‑integrity monitoring on critical dependencies.
The disclosure comes as Socket uncovered two other npm packages – pumptoolforvolumeandcomment and debugdogs – to deliver an obfuscated payload that siphons cryptocurrency keys, wallet files, and trading data related to a cryptocurrency platform named BullX on and macOS systems. The captured data is exfiltrated to a Telegram bot.
While ""pumptoolforvolumeandcomment"" has been downloaded 625 times, ""debugdogs"" have received a total of 119 downloads since they were both published to npm in September 2024 by a user named ""olumideyo.""

""Debugdogs simply invokes pumptoolforvolumeandcomment, making it a convenient secondary infection payload,"" security researcher Kush Pandya said. ""This 'wrapper' pattern doubles down on the main attack, making it easier to spread under multiple names without changing the core malicious code.""
""This highly targeted attack can empty wallets and expose sensitive credentials and trading data in seconds.""
Npm Package ""rand-user-agent"" Compromised in Supply Chain Attack#
The discovery also follows a report from Aikido about a supply chain attack that has compromised a legitimate npm package called ""rand-user-agent"" to inject code that conceals a remote access trojan (RAT). Versions 2.0.83, 2.0.84, and 1.0.110 have been found to be malicious.
The newly released versions, per security researcher Charlie Eriksen, are designed to establish communications with an external server to receive commands that allow it to change the current working directory, upload files, and execute shell commands. The compromise was detected on May 5, 2025.
At the time of writing, the npm package has been marked deprecated and the associated GitHub repository is also no longer accessible, redirecting users to a 404 page.
It's currently not clear how the npm package was breached to make the unauthorized modifications. Users who have upgraded to 2.0.83, 2.0.84, or 1.0.110 are advised to downgrade it back to the last safe version released seven months ago (2.0.82). However, doing so does not remove the malware from the system.
Update#
WebScrapingAPI, which maintains the ""rand-user-agent"" library, told SecurityWeek that the unknown threat actors published the malicious package versions after obtaining an outdated automation token that was not protected by two-factor authentication."
2025-05-20 02:15:19,"May 09, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/google-rolls-out-on-device-ai.html,Google Rolls Out On-Device AI Protections to Detect Scams in Chrome and Android,"Google on Thursday announced it's rolling out new artificial intelligence (AI)-powered countermeasures to combat scams across Chrome, Search, and Android.
The tech giant said it will begin using Gemini Nano, its on-device large language model (LLM), to improve Safe Browsing in Chrome 137 on desktops.
""The on-device approach provides instant insight on risky websites and allows us to offer protection, even against scams that haven't been seen before. Gemini Nano's LLM is perfect for this use because of its ability to distill the varied, complex nature of websites, helping us adapt to new scam tactics more quickly,"" the company said.
Google noted that it's already using this AI-driven approach to tackle remote tech support scams, which often seek to trick users into parting with their personal or financial information under the pretext of a non-existent computer problem.
This works by evaluating the web pages using the LLM for potential signals that are emblematic of tech support scams, such as the use of the keyboard lock API. The security signals are then extracted and passed to Safe Browsing to determine if the page is likely a scam.

""In addition to ensuring that the LLM is only triggered sparingly and run locally on the device, we carefully manage resource consumption by considering the number of tokens used, running the process asynchronously to avoid interrupting browser activity, and implementing throttling and quota enforcement mechanisms to limit GPU usage,"" Jasika Bawa, Andy Lim, and Xinghui Lu of the Google Chrome Security team said.
Google said it intends to expand this feature to detect other kinds of scams, including those related to package tracking and unpaid tolls. The feature is also expected to be rolled out to Chrome on Android later this year.
As part of the announcement, Google also revealed that it has enhanced its AI-powered scam detection systems to ensnare 20 times more deceptive pages and block such pages from search results, reducing schemes that impersonate airline customer service providers by over 80% and those that mimic official resources like visas and government services by over 70% in 2024.
Overview of how on-device LLM assistance in mitigating scams works
Lastly, Google said it's launching a new warnings feature for Chrome on Android that uses an on-device machine learning model to alert users of unwanted notifications sent by malicious sites that aim to trick them into downloading suspicious software or providing sensitive data.
""This new feature uses on-device machine learning to detect and warn you about potentially deceptive or spammy notifications, giving you an extra level of control over the information displayed on your device,"" Chrome Security's Hannah Buonomo and Sarah Krakowiak Criel said.
""When a notification is flagged by Chrome, you'll see the name of the site sending the notification, a message warning that the contents of the notification are potentially deceptive or spammy, and the option to either unsubscribe from the site or see the flagged content.""

The features come a little over two months after Google rolled out AI-powered scam detection features in the Messages app for Android. Last year, the company unveiled similar ways to flag scam calls.
The updates also arrive as Google appears to be readying an Advanced Protection feature in Android 16 that, in some ways, mirrors Apple's approach by turning off JavaScript, disabling 2G connections, and activating a number of security features by default, such as Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock, Android Safe Browsing, and spam protection in Messages.
Google has also been spotted working on a feature to detect scams that coax victims into opening their banking apps during phone calls, Android Authority reported earlier this week.
Update#
Google has officially announced an Advanced Protection feature in Android 16 that, similar to Apple's Lockdown Mode, ""ensures all of Android's highest security features are enabled and are seamlessly working together to safeguard you against online attacks, harmful apps, and data risks.""

In addition to activating a wide range of security settings across many apps and services, the feature introduces a new feature called Intrusion Logging that securely backs up device logs in a privacy-preserving and tamper-resistant way for follow-up forensic analysis.

The company has also unveiled new in-call protections that prevent users from disabling Google Play Protect, sideloading apps, or granting accessibility permissions, as well as alert users of possible scams when a participating banking app is launched during a screen sharing session with an unknown contact.
""This feature will be enabled automatically for participating banking apps whenever you're on a phone call with an unknown contact on Android 11+ devices,"" Google said, adding it's currently piloting the technology with U.K. banks Monzo, NatWest, and Revolut.
Another new feature concerns expanded real-time Scam Detection in Google Messages to flag toll road and other billing fee scams, crypto scams, financial impersonation scams, gift card and prize scams, and technical support scams.
To better fight fraud and impersonation attempts, Google said it's also launching a new tool named Key Verifier that allows two parties to verify the identity of each other through public encryption keys. The feature is expected to roll out this summer in Google Messages on Android 10+ devices.
""By verifying contact keys in your Google Contacts app (through a QR code scanning or number comparison), you can have an extra layer of assurance that the person on the other end is genuine and that your conversation is private with them,"" the tech giant said.
What's more, Google said it's hardening Factory Reset protections to restrict all functionality on devices reset without the owner's authorization. Device owners can also add a security challenge question to prevent devices from being locked out without their permission.
""We're also enhancing your security against thieves in Android 16 by providing more protection for one-time passwords that are received when your phone is locked,"" Google said. ""In higher risk scenarios, Android will hide one-time passwords on your lock screen, ensuring that only you can see them after unlocking your device.""
Lastly, the company is adding new features to its Google Play Protect live detection program to identify unsafe apps that aim to deceive people by hiding or changing their icons. The feature will be available in the coming months for users running Google Pixel 6+ and select new devices from other manufacturers.
(The story was updated after publication on May 14, 2025, to include details of the Advanced Protection feature on Android 16.)"

The reactive nature of vulnerability management, combined with delays from policy and process, strains security teams. Capacity is limited and patching everything immediately is a struggle. Our Vulnerability Operation Center (VOC) dataset analysis identified 1,337,797 unique findings (security issues) across 68,500 unique customer assets. 32,585 of them were distinct CVEs, with 10,014 having a CVSS score of 8 or higher. Among these, external assets have 11,605 distinct CVEs, while internal assets have 31,966. With this volume of CVEs, it's no surprise that some go unpatched and lead to compromises.

Why are we stuck in this situation, what can be done, and is there a better approach out there?
We'll explore the state of vulnerability reporting, how to prioritize vulnerabilities by threat and exploitation, examine statistical probabilities, and briefly discuss risk. Lastly, we'll consider solutions to minimize vulnerability impact while giving management teams flexibility in crisis response. This should give a good impression, but if you want the full story you can find it in our annual report, the Security Navigator.
Can You CVE What I CVE?#
Western nations and organizations use the Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE) and Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to track and rate vulnerabilities, overseen by US government-funded programs like MITRE and NIST. By September 2024, the CVE program, active for 25 years, had published over 264,000 CVEs, and by 15 April 2025, the number of total CVEs increased to approximately 290,000 CVEs including ""Rejected"" or ""Deferred"". 
NIST's National Vulnerability Database (NVD) relies on CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs) to record CVEs with initial CVSS assessments, which helps scale the process but also introduces biases. The disclosure of serious vulnerabilities is complicated by disagreements between researchers and vendors over impact, relevance, and accuracy, affecting the wider community [1, 2].
By April 2025, a backlog of more than 24,000 unenriched CVEs accumulated at the NVD [3, 4] due to bureaucratic delays that occurred in March 2024. Temporarily halting CVE enrichment despite ongoing vulnerability reports, and dramatically illustrating the fragility of this system. The temporary pause resulted in this backlog that is yet to be cleared. 

On 15 April 2025, MITRE announced that the US Department of Homeland Security will not be renewing its contract with MITRE, impacting the CVE program directly[15]. This created a lot of uncertainty about the future of CVEs and how it will impact cybersecurity practitioners. Fortunately, funding for the CVE program was extended due to the strong community and industry response[16].

CVE and the NVD are not the sole sources of vulnerability intelligence. Many organizations, including ours, develop independent products that track far more vulnerabilities than the MITRE's CVE program and NIST NVD.
Since 2009, China has operated its own vulnerability database, CNNVD [5], which could be a valuable technical resource [6, 7], though political barriers make collaboration unlikely. Moreover, not all vulnerabilities are disclosed immediately, creating blind spots, while some are exploited without detection—so-called 0-days.
In 2023, Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) and Mandiant identified 97 zero-day exploits, primarily affecting mobile devices, operating systems, browsers, and other applications. Meanwhile, only about 6% of vulnerabilities in the CVE dictionary have ever been exploited [8], and studies from 2022 show that half of organizations patch just 15.5% or fewer vulnerabilities monthly [9].
While CVE is crucial for security managers, it's an imperfect, voluntary system, neither globally regulated nor universally adopted.
This blog also aims to explore how we might reduce reliance on it in our daily operations.
Threat Informed#
Despite its shortcomings, the CVE system still provides valuable intelligence on vulnerabilities that could impact security. However, with so many CVEs to address, we must prioritize those most likely to be exploited by threat actors.
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), developed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) SIG [10], helps predict the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited in the wild. With EPSS intelligence, security managers can either prioritize patching as many CVEs as possible for broad coverage or focus on critical vulnerabilities to maximize efficiency and prevent exploitation. Both approaches have pros and cons.
To demonstrate the tradeoff between coverage and efficiency, we need two datasets: one representing potential patches (VOC dataset) and another representing actively exploited vulnerabilities, which includes CISA KEV [10], ethical hacking findings, and data from our CERT Vulnerability Intelligence Watch service [12].

The EPSS threshold is used to select a set of CVEs to patch, based on how likely they are to be exploited in the wild. The overlap between the remediation set and the exploited vulnerability set can be used to calculate the Efficiency, Coverage, and Effort of a selected strategy. 
EPSS predicts the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited somewhere in the wild, not on any specific system. However, probabilities can ""scale."" For example, flipping one coin gives a 50% chance of heads, but flipping 10 coins raises the chance of at least one head to 99.9%. This scaling is calculated using the complement rule [13], which finds the probability of the desired outcome by subtracting the chance of failure from 1.
As FIRST explains, ""EPSS predicts the probability of a specific vulnerability being exploited and can be scaled to estimate threats across servers, subnets, or entire enterprises by calculating the probability of at least one event occurring.""[14, 15]
With EPSS, we can similarly calculate the likelihood of at least one vulnerability being exploited from a list by using the complement rule.
To demonstrate, we analyzed 397 vulnerabilities from the VOC scan data of a Public Administration sector client. As the chart below illustrates, most vulnerabilities had low EPSS scores until a sharp rise at position 276. Also shown on the chart is the scaled probability of exploitation using the complement rule, which effectively reaches 100% when only the first 264 vulnerabilities are considered.

As the scaled EPSS curve (left) on the chart indicates, as more CVEs are considered, the scaled probability that one of them will be exploited in the wild increases very rapidly. By the time there are 265 distinct CVEs under consideration, the probability that one of them will be exploited in the wild is more than 99%. This level is reached before any individual vulnerabilities with high EPSS come into consideration. When the scaled EPSS value crosses 99% (Position 260) the maximum EPSS is still under 11% (0.11). 
This example, based on actual client data on vulnerabilities exposed to the Internet, shows how difficult prioritizing vulnerabilities becomes as the number of systems increases.
EPSS gives a probability that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild, which is helpful for defenders, but we've shown how quickly this probability scales when multiple vulnerabilities are involved. With enough vulnerabilities, there is a real probability that one will get exploited, even when the individual EPSS scores are low.
Like a weather forecast predicting a ""chance of rain,"" the larger the area, the greater the likelihood of rain somewhere. Likewise, it is likely impossible to reduce the probability of exploitation even closer down to zero. 

Attacker Odds#
We've identified three critical truths that must be integrated into our examination of the vulnerability management process:

Attackers aren't focused on specific vulnerabilities; they aim to compromise systems.
Exploiting vulnerabilities isn't the only path to compromise.
Attackers' skill and persistence levels vary.

These factors allow us to extend our analysis of EPSS and probabilities to consider the likelihood of an attacker compromising some arbitrary system, then scaling that to determine the probability of compromising some system within a network that grants access to the rest.
We can assume each hacker has a certain ""probability"" of compromising a system, with this probability increasing based on their skill, experience, tools, and time. We can then continue applying probability scaling to assess attacker success against a broader computer environment.

Given a patient, undetected hacker, how many attempts are statistically required to breach a system granting access to the graph? Answering this requires applying a reworked binomial distribution in the form of this equation [16, 17]:

Using this equation, we can estimate how many attempts an attacker of a certain skill level would need. For instance, if attacker A1 has a 5% success rate (1 in 20) per system, they would need to target up to 180 systems to be 99.99% sure of success.
Another attacker, A2, with a 10% success rate (1 in 10), would need about 88 targets to ensure at least one success, while a more skilled attacker, A3, with a 20% success rate (1 in 5), would only need around 42 targets for the same probability.
These are probabilities—an attacker might succeed on the first try or require multiple attempts to reach the expected success rate. To assess real-world impact, we surveyed senior penetration testers in our business, who estimated their success rate against arbitrary internet-connected targets to be around 30%.
Assuming a skilled attacker has a 5% to 40% chance of compromising a single machine, we can now estimate how many targets would be needed to nearly guarantee one successful compromise. 

The implications are striking: with just 100 potential targets, even a moderately skilled attacker is almost certain to succeed at least once. In a typical enterprise, this single compromise often provides access to the wider network, and enterprises typically have thousands of computers to consider.
Reimagining Vulnerability Management#
For the future, we need to conceive an environment and architecture that is immune to compromise from an individual system. In the short term, we argue that our approach to vulnerability management needs to change.
The current approach to vulnerability management is rooted in its name: focusing on ""vulnerabilities"" (as defined by CVE, CVSS, EPSS, misconfiguration, errors, etc) and their ""management."" However, we have no control over the volume, speed, or significance of CVEs, leading us to constantly react to chaotic new intelligence.
EPSS helps us prioritize vulnerabilities likely to be exploited in the wild, representing real threats, which forces us into a reactive mode. While mitigation addresses vulnerabilities, our response is truly about countering threats—hence, this process should be called Threat Mitigation.
As discussed earlier, it's statistically impossible to effectively counter threats in large enterprises by merely reacting to vulnerability intelligence. Risk Reduction is about the best we can do. Cyber risk results from a threat targeting a system's assets, leveraging vulnerabilities, and the potential impact of such an attack. By addressing risk, we open up more areas under our control to manage and mitigate.

Threat Mitigation#
Threat Mitigation is a dynamic, ongoing process that involves identifying threats, assessing their relevance, and taking action to mitigate them. This response can include patching, reconfiguring, filtering, adding compensating controls, or even removing vulnerable systems. EPSS is a valuable tool that complements other sources of threat and vulnerability intelligence.
However, the scaling nature of probabilities makes EPSS less useful in large internal environments. Since EPSS focuses on vulnerabilities likely to be exploited ""in the wild,"" it is most applicable to systems directly exposed to the internet. Therefore, Threat Mitigation efforts should primarily target those externally exposed systems.
Risk Reduction#
Cyber risk is a product of Threat, Vulnerability, and Impact. While the ""Threat"" is largely beyond our control, patching specific vulnerabilities in large environments doesn't significantly lower the risk of compromise. Therefore, risk reduction should focus on three key efforts:

Reducing the attack surface: As the probability of compromise increases with scale, it can be reduced by shrinking the attack surface. A key priority is identifying and removing unmanaged or unnecessary internet-facing systems.
Limiting the impact: Lambert's law advises limiting attackers' ability to access and traverse the ""graph."" This is achieved through segmentation at all levels—network, permissions, applications, and data. The Zero Trust architecture provides a practical reference model for this goal.
Improving the baseline: Instead of focusing on specific vulnerabilities as they're reported or discovered, systematically reducing the overall number and severity of vulnerabilities lowers the risk of compromise. This approach prioritizes efficiency and Return on Investment, ignoring current acute threats in favor of long-term risk reduction.

By separating Threat Mitigation from Risk Reduction, we can break free from the constant cycle of reacting to specific threats and focus on more efficient, strategic approaches, freeing up resources for other priorities.
An Efficient Approach#
This approach can be pursued systematically to optimize resources. The focus shifts from ""managing vulnerabilities"" to designing, implementing, and validating resilient architectures and baseline configurations. Once these baselines are set by security, IT can take over their implementation and maintenance. 
The key here is that the ""trigger"" for patching internal systems is a predefined plan, agreed with system owners, to upgrade to a new, approved baseline. This approach is certain to be much less disruptive and more efficient than constantly chasing the latest vulnerabilities.
Vulnerability Scanning remains important for creating an accurate asset inventory and identifying non-compliant systems. It can support existing standardized processes, instead of triggering them.
Shaping the Future#
The overwhelming barrage of randomly discovered and reported vulnerabilities as represented by CVE, CVSS and EPSS are stressing our people, processes and technology. We've effectively been approaching vulnerability management the same way for over two decades, with moderate success.
It's time to reimagine how we design, build, and maintain systems.

A Template for a New Strategy#
Key factors to consider for security strategies toward 2030 and beyond:

Starting at the source
Human Factor
Leverage human strengths and anticipate their weaknesses.Gain support from senior management and executives.Be an enabler, not a blocker.
Threat-Informed Decision Making
Learn from incidents and focus on what's being exploited.Use strategies to enhance remediation based on your capabilities.
Threat Modeling and Simulation
Use threat models to understand potential attack paths.Conduct Ethical Hacking to test your environment against real threats.
System Architecture and Design
Apply threat models and simulations to validate assumptions in new systems.Reduce the attack surface systematically.Strengthen defense in depth by reviewing existing systems.Treat SASE and Zero-Trust as strategies, not just technology.
Secure by Demand / Default
Implement formal policies to embed security into corporate culture.Ensure vendors and suppliers have active security improvement programs.

2025-05-20 02:15:25,"May 09, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/chinese-hackers-exploit-sap-rce-flaw.html,"Chinese Hackers Exploit SAP RCE Flaw CVE-2025-31324, Deploy Golang-Based SuperShell","A China-linked unnamed threat actor dubbed Chaya_004 has been observed exploiting a recently disclosed security flaw in SAP NetWeaver.
Forescout Vedere Labs, in a report published Thursday, said it uncovered a malicious infrastructure likely associated with the hacking group weaponizing CVE-2025-31324 (CVSS score: 10.0) since April 29, 2025.
CVE-2025-31324 refers to a critical SAP NetWeaver flaw that allows attackers to achieve remote code execution (RCE) by uploading web shells through a susceptible ""/developmentserver/metadatauploader"" endpoint.
The vulnerability was first flagged by ReliaQuest late last month when it found the shortcoming being abused in real-world attacks by unknown threat actors to drop web shells and the Brute Ratel C4 post-exploitation framework.

According to Onapsis, hundreds of SAP systems globally have fallen victim to attacks spanning industries and geographies, including energy and utilities, manufacturing, media and entertainment, oil and gas, pharmaceuticals, retail, and government organizations.
The SAP security firm said it observed reconnaissance activity that involved ""testing with specific payloads against this vulnerability"" against its honeypots as far back as January 20, 2025. Successful compromises in deploying web shells were observed between March 14 and March 31.
Google-owned Mandiant, which is also engaged in incident response efforts related to these attacks, has evidence of first known exploitation occurring on March 12, 2025.

In recent days, multiple threat actors are said to have jumped aboard the exploitation bandwagon to opportunistically target vulnerable systems to deploy web shells and even mine cryptocurrency.
This, per Forescout, also includes Chaya_004, which has hosted a web-based reverse shell written in Golang called SuperShell on the IP address 47.97.42[.]177. The operational technology (OT) security company said it extracted the IP address from an ELF binary named config that was put to use in the attack.
""On the same IP address hosting Supershell (47.97.42[.]177), we also identified several other open ports, including 3232/HTTP using an anomalous self-signed certificate impersonating Cloudflare with the following properties: Subject DN: C=US, O=Cloudflare, Inc, CN=:3232,"" Forescout researchers Sai Molige and Luca Barba said.

Further analysis has uncovered the threat actor has to be hosting various tools across infrastructure: NPS, SoftEther VPN, Cobalt Strike, Asset Reconnaissance Lighthouse (ARL), Pocassit, GOSINT, and GO Simple Tunnel.
""The use of Chinese cloud providers and several Chinese-language tools points to a threat actor likely based in China,"" the researchers added.
To defend against attacks, it's essential that users apply the patches as soon as possible, if not already, restrict access to the metadata uploader endpoint, disable the Visual Composer service if not in use, and monitor for suspicious activity.
Onapsis CTO Juan Pablo JP Perez-Etchegoyen told The Hacker News that the activity highlighted by Forescout is post-patch, and that it ""will further expand the threat of leveraging deployed web shells not only to opportunistic (and potentially less sophisticated) threat actors, but also more advanced ones seem to have been rapidly reacting to this issue to leverage the existing compromises and further expand."""
2025-05-20 02:15:25,"May 08, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/38000-freedrain-subdomains-found.html,"38,000+ FreeDrain Subdomains Found Exploiting SEO to Steal Crypto Wallet Seed Phrases","Cybersecurity researchers have exposed what they say is an ""industrial-scale, global cryptocurrency phishing operation"" engineered to steal digital assets from cryptocurrency wallets for several years.
The campaign has been codenamed FreeDrain by threat intelligence firms SentinelOne and Validin.
""FreeDrain uses SEO manipulation, free-tier web services (like gitbook.io, webflow.io, and github.io), and layered redirection techniques to target cryptocurrency wallets,"" security researchers Kenneth Kinion, Sreekar Madabushi, and Tom Hegel said in a technical report shared with The Hacker News.
""Victims search for wallet-related queries, click on high-ranking malicious results, land on lure pages, and are redirected to phishing pages that steal their seed phrases.""
The scale of the campaign is reflected in the fact that over 38,000 distinct FreeDrain sub-domains hosting lure pages have been identified. These pages are hosted on cloud infrastructure like Amazon S3 and Azure Web Apps, and mimic legitimate cryptocurrency wallet interfaces.
The activity has been attributed with high confidence to individuals based in the Indian Standard Time (IST) time zone, working standard weekday hours, citing patterns of GitHub commits associated with the lure pages.
The attacks have been found to target users searching for wallet-related queries like ""Trezor wallet balance"" on search engines like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, redirecting them to bogus landing pages hosted on gitbook.io, webflow.io, and github.io.

Unsuspecting users who land on these pages are served a static screenshot of the legitimate wallet interface, clicking which, one of the below three behaviors happen -

Redirect the user to legitimate websites
Redirect the user to other intermediary sites
Direct the user to a lookalike phishing page that prompts them to enter their seed phrase, effectively draining their wallets

""The entire flow is frictionless by design, blending SEO manipulation, familiar visual elements, and platform trust to lull victims into a false sense of legitimacy,"" the researchers said. ""And once a seed phrase is submitted, the attacker's automated infrastructure will drain funds within minutes.""

It is believed that the textual content used in these decoy pages is generated using large language models like OpenAI GPT-4o, indicative of how threat actors are abusing generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to produce content at scale.
FreeDrain has also been observed resorting to flooding poorly-maintained websites with thousands of spammy comments to boost the visibility of their lure pages via search engine indexing, a technique called spamdexing that's often used to game SEO.
It's worth pointing out that some aspects of the campaign have been documented by Netskope Threat Labs since August 2022 and as recently as October 2024, when the threat actors were found utilizing Webflow to spin up phishing sites masquerading as Coinbase, MetaMask, Phantom, Trezor, and Bitbuy.
""FreeDrain's reliance on free-tier platforms is not unique, and without better safeguards, these services will continue to be weaponized at scale,"" the researchers noted.
""The FreeDrain network represents a modern blueprint for scalable phishing operations, one that thrives on free-tier platforms, evades traditional abuse detection methods, and adapts rapidly to infrastructure takedowns. By abusing dozens of legitimate services to host content, distribute lure pages, and route victims, FreeDrain has built a resilient ecosystem that's difficult to disrupt and easy to rebuild.""
The disclosure comes as Check Point Research said it uncovered a sophisticated phishing campaign that abuses Discord and singles out cryptocurrency users in order to steal their funds using a Drainer-as-a-Service (DaaS) tool called Inferno Drainer.
The attacks entice victims into joining a malicious Discord server by hijacking expired vanity invite links, while also taking advantage of Discord OAuth2 authentication flow to evade automated detection of their malicious websites.
Breakdown of total domains into suspected and confirmed URLs by quantity.
Between September 2024 and March 2025, more than 30,000 unique wallets are estimated to have been victimized by Inferno Drainer, leading to at least $9 million in losses.
Inferno Drainer claimed to have shut down its operations in November 2023. But the latest findings reveal that the crypto drainer remains active, employing single-use smart contracts and on-chain encrypted configurations to make detection more challenging.
""Attackers redirect users from a legitimate Web3 website to a fake Collab.Land bot and then to a phishing site, tricking them into signing malicious transactions,"" the company said. ""The drainer script deployed on that site was directly linked to Inferno Drainer.""

""Inferno Drainer employs advanced anti-detection tactics — including single-use and short-lived smart contracts, on-chain encrypted configurations, and proxy-based communication — successfully bypassing wallet security mechanisms and anti-phishing blacklists.""
The findings also follow the discovery of a malvertising campaign that leverages Facebook ads that impersonate trusted cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms like Binance, Bybit, and TradingView to lead users to sketchy websites instructing them to download a desktop client.
""Query parameters related to Facebook Ads are used to detect legitimate victims, while suspicious or automated analysis environments receive benign content,"" Bitdefender said in a report shared with the publication.
""If the site detects suspicious conditions (e.g., missing ad-tracking parameters or an environment typical of automated security analysis), it displays harmless, unrelated content instead.""
The installer, once launched, displays the login page of the impersonated entity through msedge_proxy.exe to keep up the ruse, while additional payloads are silently executed in the background to harvest system information, or execute a sleep command for ""hundreds of hours on end"" if the exfiltrated data indicates a sandboxing environment.
The Romanian cybersecurity company said hundreds of Facebook accounts have advertised these malware-delivering pages mainly targeting men over 18 years in Bulgaria and Slovakia.
""This campaign showcases a hybrid approach, merging front-end deception and a localhost-based malware service,"" it added. ""By dynamically adjusting to the victim's environment and continuously updating payloads, the threat actors maintain a resilient, highly evasive operation."""
2025-05-20 02:15:28,"May 08, 2025",The Hacker News,https://thehackernews.com,https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/security-tools-alone-dont-protect-you.html,Security Tools Alone Don't Protect You — Control Effectiveness Does,"61% of security leaders reported suffering a breach due to failed or misconfigured controls over the past 12 months. This is despite having an average of 43 cybersecurity tools in place.
This massive rate of security failure is clearly not a security investment problem. It is a configuration problem. Organizations are beginning to understand that a security control installed or deployed is not necessarily a security control configured to defend against real-world threats.
The recent Gartner® Report, Reduce Threat Exposure With Security Controls Optimization, addresses the gap between intention and outcome. We feel it discusses a hard truth: without continuous validation and tuning, security tools deliver a false sense of, well, security.

In this article, we'll take a deep dive into why control effectiveness should be the new benchmark for cybersecurity success, and how organizations can make this shift.
The Myth of Tool Coverage#
Buying more tools has long been considered the key to cybersecurity performance. Yet the facts tell a different story. According to the Gartner report, ""misconfiguration of technical security controls is a leading cause for the continued success of attacks."" 
Many organizations have impressive inventories of firewalls, endpoint solutions, identity tools, SIEMs, and other controls. Yet breaches continue because these tools are often misconfigured, poorly integrated, or disconnected from actual business risks. 
For example, in the 2024 breach at Blue Shield of California, a website misconfiguration led to personal data from 4.7 million members leaking via Google Ads. This failure revealed how even everyday tools, if incorrectly deployed or configured, can undermine organizational security and compliance.
Yet closing the gap between the presence of security tools and their efficacy requires a fundamental shift in thinking, and an even more fundamental shift in practice.
Making the Organizational Shift to Control Effectiveness#
Moving toward true control effectiveness takes more than just a few technical tweaks. It requires a real shift - in mindset, in day-to-day practice, and in how teams across the organization work together. Success depends on stronger partnerships between security teams, asset owners, IT operations, and business leaders. Asset owners, in particular, bring critical knowledge to the table - how their systems are built, where the sensitive data lives, and which processes are too important to fail.
Supporting this collaboration also means rethinking how we train teams. Security professionals need more than technical skills - they need a deeper understanding of the assets they're protecting, the business goals those assets support, and the real-world threats that could impact them.
And it's not just about better teamwork or better training. Organizations also need better ways to measure whether their controls are actually doing the job. That's where outcome-driven metrics (ODMs) and protection-level agreements (PLAs) come in. ODMs show how quickly misconfigurations are fixed and how reliably true threats are detected. PLAs set clear expectations for how defenses should perform against specific risks.
Together, these measurements move security from a matter of trust to a matter of proof. They help organizations build resilience that they can measure, manage, and improve over time.
Continuous Optimization Is the New Normal#
Measuring security effectiveness is a critical first step — but maintaining it is where the real challenge begins. Security controls aren't static. They need regular tuning to stay effective as threats evolve and businesses change. As Gartner states, ""optimal configuration of technical security controls is a moving target, not a set-and-forget or a default setting.""
Teams that treat configuration as a one-off project are setting themselves up to fall behind. New vulnerabilities emerge, attackers shift their tactics, and cloud environments evolve faster than any annual audit can keep up with. In this environment, patching systems once a quarter or reviewing settings once a year simply isn't enough. Continuous optimization has to become part of the day-to-day.

That means making it a habit to step back and ask the tough questions: Are our controls still protecting what matters most? Are our detection rules tuned to the threats we're facing today? Are our compensating measures still closing the right gaps — or have they drifted out of sync?
Keeping defenses sharp isn't just about applying technical updates. It's about integrating real-world threat intelligence, reassessing risk priorities, and making sure operational processes are strengthening security - not introducing new weaknesses. Security effectiveness isn't a box you check once. It's something you build, test, and refine - over and over again.
Building for Effectiveness: What Needs to Change#
Making security controls truly effective demands a broader shift in how organizations think and work. Security optimization must be embedded into how systems are designed, operated, and maintained - not treated as a separate function. 
Gartner notes that ""no security team can be fully effective in isolation."" In XM Cyber's view, this means security needs to become a team sport. Organizations need to build cross-functional teams that bring together security engineers, IT operations, asset owners, and business stakeholders. Effective optimization depends on understanding not just how controls work, but what they are protecting, how those systems behave, and where the real business risks lie.
Aligning security control efforts with a broader Continuous Exposure Management program also helps build a repeatable, structured way to improve over time. Instead of reacting to gaps after a breach, organizations can proactively identify weaknesses, fine-tune controls, and measure progress against real risk reduction - not just theoretical coverage.

The Bottom Line#
Security has never been about simply having the right tools. It is about understanding whether those tools are ready for the threats that matter most. Closing the gap between control presence and control effectiveness demands more than technical fixes. It requires a change in how organizations think, work, and measure success.
In our opinion, this new research from Gartner makes the message clear: static defenses will not keep pace with dynamic risks. Organizations that embrace continuous optimization - tuning controls, validating performance, and aligning security with real business priorities - will be the ones that stay resilient.
Standing still is falling behind, at least where cybersecurity is concerned. The future belongs to organizations that treat security as a living system - measured, tuned, and proven every day.Note: This article was expertly written and contributed by Dale Fairbrother, Director of Product Marketing at XM Cyber."

The vulnerabilities are listed below -

CVE-2025-32819 (CVSS score: 8.8) - A vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote authenticated attacker with SSL-VPN user privileges to bypass the path traversal checks and delete an arbitrary file potentially resulting in a reboot to factory default settings.
CVE-2025-32820 (CVSS score: 8.3) - A vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote authenticated attacker with SSL-VPN user privileges can inject a path traversal sequence to make any directory on the SMA appliance writable
CVE-2025-32821 (CVSS score: 6.7) - A vulnerability in SMA100 allows a remote authenticated attacker with SSL-VPN admin privileges can with admin privileges can inject shell command arguments to upload a file on the appliance

""An attacker with access to an SMA SSL-VPN user account can chain these vulnerabilities to make a sensitive system directory writable, elevate their privileges to SMA administrator, and write an executable file to a system directory,"" Rapid7 said in a report. ""This chain results in root-level remote code execution.""

CVE-2025-32819 is assessed to be a patch bypass for a previously identified flaw reported by NCC Group in December 2021.
The cybersecurity company noted that CVE-2025-32819 may have been exploited in the wild as a zero-day based on known indicators of compromise (IoCs) and incident response investigations. However, it's worth noting that SonicWall makes no mention of the flaw being weaponized in real-world attacks.
The shortcomings, that impact SMA 100 Series including SMA 200, 210, 400, 410, 500v, have been addressed in version 10.2.1.15-81sv.
The development comes as multiple security flaws in SMA 100 Series devices have come under active exploitation in recent weeks, including CVE-2021-20035, CVE-2023-44221, and CVE-2024-38475. Users are advised to update their instances to the latest version for optimal protection."
